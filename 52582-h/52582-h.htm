<h2><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>TO THE
ANGLO-SAXON RACE.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Brethren</span>,</p>
<p>The first great object which I have had in view, in the
construction of this Drama, was to bear my humble acknowledgment
to an <span class="smcap">Allwise Providence</span>, who alone
could have developed the unprecedented might of the Anglo-Saxon
Race&mdash;and who alone could have laid the foundations, or
builded up, the giant structure of the British Empire&mdash;so
vast, so rich, so powerful&mdash;unparalleled in extent, or
wealth, or population&mdash;in arts and arms, in manufactures, in
literature and laws, in civilization and commerce, in the history
of mankind.&nbsp; Great have been the four preceding Empires of
<span class="smcap">Prophecy</span>! each, for its allotted
period, having dominion over the Earth; but of none of them, as
of England, could it be said &ldquo;The abundance of the sea
shall be converted unto thee.&rdquo;&mdash;(Isaiah lx, 5)</p>
<p>Whilst I would put on record my own conviction, I would invite
the attention of my countrymen to the assured fact, that no
enlarged views of policy of our statesmen, no magnitude of our
armaments, no superior science of our Generals, have wrought this
wonder, for our race and country.&nbsp; The <span
class="smcap">peculiar Glory</span> of England is, that her
greatness is the work of <span class="smcap">God</span>! to whom
is known from the beginning the destiny of his world and the
means of carrying it out&mdash;when to put forth the fury of his
anger and the strength of battle.&nbsp; Indeed! on taking a
summary view over the wondrous past&mdash;over the steps in her
career&mdash;the evidence is striking, that her success and
conquests have been gained, without the aid or counsel&mdash;not
seldom, in defiance of her statesmen, by inexperienced generals,
and with totally inadequate means.&nbsp; That often her leading
men and government have favoured to their utmost her enemies, and
poured ignominy and vituperation, injustice and persecution, on
those that served her, the valiant and the wise who have
<i>achieved</i> her triumphs and her greatness.&nbsp; This has
been peculiarly the case with regard to the great Actors with
whom we are at present concerned, whose transactions and virtues
we would illustrate, and of the age of which we have endeavoured
to give &ldquo;the form and pressure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is impossible to doubt that the strength of England lies in
her Navy&mdash;that her Navy results from her commerce&mdash;her
vast and unequalled commerce from her manufactures; therefore
that we cannot err in selecting the reign of Elizabeth, as the
starting point in her progress.&nbsp; And examining closely the
transactions and opinions, the struggles and changes during that
reign, we may clearly discover, not only the truth of the
statement, but the manner and the agency by which her success was
achieved.&nbsp; It certainly was not by the statesmen&mdash;of
these most, steeped in baseness and corruption, were ready to
sell their services for direct bribes to the enemies of their
Queen and country.&nbsp; Some were in the interest; of Spain,
some in that of France, or the Queen of Scots.&nbsp; Those that
were for their Queen were entirely wrong in their views and
policy, which, if carried out, would have frustrated forever the
prosperity of England.</p>
<p><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>All were
at variance among themselves.&nbsp; The Queen differed with them
all in her principles and policy.&nbsp; She loved her country,
its glory and independence; and to secure these, pursued her own
eccentric and mysterious path, urged on by impulse, instinctive,
spiritual or Angelic, maintaining it with apparent self-will and
unreasonableness, perverseness and irresolution, vacillation and
caprice.&nbsp; But still, in proud and lonely grandeur, with
unflinching courage and firmness, undeterred by the fear of war
or assassination, &ldquo;<i>Semper Eadem</i>,&rdquo; against all
opposition.&nbsp; She foiled with unexampled and unfailing skill,
traitors and spies, and false advisers, and every species of
secret or open foe, constrained to fence, deceive, betray, even
to coquet, to save her country, her throne, and her life!&nbsp;
She came through it all in triumph with the <span
class="smcap">trident</span> of the <span
class="smcap">ocean</span> in her grasp, acknowledged by the
Nations, as the &ldquo;<span class="smcap">Queen of the
Sea</span>, the Restorer of Naval glory.&rdquo;&nbsp; Even the
Pope (Sixtus V.) forgetting the policy of his faith, was struck
with admiration of &ldquo;this valiant and noble
woman.&rdquo;&nbsp; The name of her great hero, Drake (Il Draco)
was constantly in his mouth, who, he said, &ldquo;took the King
of Spain by the beard,&rdquo; and he ascribed the exploits which
filled Europe with their fame to the high spirit of the Queen who
sent him out.</p>
<p>The reign of Elizabeth is one of the most glorious epochs in
the history of our Nation&mdash;a most important <span
class="smcap">crisis</span> in the Destiny of the World.</p>
<p>The Feudal system, which, with brute force, had trampled down
humanity in its own blood, had spent its fury.&nbsp; That Iron
Age was fast fading away.&nbsp; A brilliant dawn had unexpectedly
appeared, of that Intelligence, which with the power of Science
and Manufactures, Commerce, and the rights of Man, was to rule
the world.&nbsp; Our great race, having &ldquo;renewed its
strength in the Islands&rdquo; with the &ldquo;abundance of the
sea converted&rdquo; to it, was now to go forth on its mission,
and push its people to the utmost bounds of the everlasting
hills.</p>
<p>The Wars of the Roses, battle and the block, had consumed the
Barons, the Knights, and the Men-at-arms.&nbsp; The Church, which
had endeavoured to strangle Liberty and Thought itself, was now a
crumbling and bloody ruin, shorn of its pomp, its authority, and
its land.</p>
<p>A <span class="smcap">New Power</span> was rising from the
Sea, before which the Earth was to quail, and its despotisms to
succumb.&nbsp; Elizabeth was the head, the Elect of Providence,
to lead it forth into action, and the noble Spirits who were
driven by the bigotry and persecution of the Marian faction to
the liberty of the wild waves, as freebooters, were the
accomplished instruments to effect its purpose.&nbsp; Light and
Darkness, Liberty and Despotism, had once more entered on a
mortal struggle, and the Ocean was the arena on which they were
to fight it out&mdash;Spain and the Pope on one side, England on
the other.&nbsp; That <span class="smcap">Struggle</span> it is
the <span class="smcap">purpose</span> of the present Drama to
represent, its Nature, its Conduct, its Agents, and its
Issue.</p>
<p>We shall just make a sketch, take a view of the combatants who
were to enter the lists for this great contest&mdash;as of yore,
Rome and Carthage, for the possession of the world.&nbsp; Not to
take into account the Pope, whose influence on any side was so
vast over the minds of men; and which was entirely against
England, Spain, whose own people were then the foremost military
nation by sea and land, had also under her command the whole of
the princes of Italy, the House of Austria with its vast
connexions, the <a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
5</span>Low Countries, the seat of Arts, Manufactures, trade and
Commerce; America&mdash;a New World!&mdash;pouring the wonderful
wealth of its mines into her lap; lastly Portugal, and with it
the Commerce of the East.</p>
<p>England stood alone against a giant that bestrode the world!
and what was she at that moment?&nbsp; Weakened by civil war in
many a bloody field&mdash;disorganized by misgovernment, divided
by religion, and rival claims to the Crown&mdash;without a
regular army, or her ancient discipline, without much of a Royal
Navy, or the finances to create one.&nbsp; A girl of twenty-five,
her presiding genius, by her own singular wisdom, without
Statesmen whose advice she could follow&mdash;her very Cabinet
Council in receipt of bribes from her enemies&mdash;war in
Ireland aided by Spain&mdash;France threatening her through
Scotland&mdash;thus <span class="smcap">distracted</span>, to be
invaded by the whole power of Spain!</p>
<p>Where were the Iron men who, a few years ago, swept France
before them in every battle, though outnumbered by twenty to one,
until they made it an appanage to the Crown of England?&nbsp;
They were sleeping in their bloody shrouds on many a field like
that of Touton and Barnet, or their bones had been stuck to
moulder on City gates and Castle walls.&nbsp; In their days no
one dreamt of invasion.&nbsp; But now! although the spirit of the
men of a later day, who chased the Chivalry of France at the
battle of the <span class="smcap">spurs</span>, and smote down
the might of Scotland on red Flodden, was still burning in the
bosoms of their descendants, from many causes&mdash;such as the
confusion in the succession to the crown, the decay of the Feudal
system, the total change in military science, England without an
Army, or sufficient Navy, or finances to create one, was quite
unprepared for war.</p>
<p>Considering the vast odds, the success of Spain seemed
certain&mdash;the ultimate triumph of England by herself, a thing
absolutely impossible.&nbsp; The rational mind is constrained to
the conclusion that it was the work of God for the purpose of
developing the Anglo-Saxon race, a new ordering of the nations,
and a new disposal of the possession of the Earth.&nbsp; All
which directly followed, or is still in progress.</p>
<p>It is necessary for our purpose to take note also of the mode
or means by which this mighty duel was carried on.&nbsp; Philip
aspired to universal dominion; England was the great obstacle
that stood in his way.&nbsp; His first endeavour was to obtain
the hand of Elizabeth, and thus to become its king as he had been
before.&nbsp; Failing in this, he tried to flatter and cajole
her, by his Ambassadors and hirelings, into a belief that he was
her friend, without whom she could not reign; whilst all the time
he was labouring to have her assassinated&mdash;organizing
rebellion against her by Jesuit spies&mdash;Then he tried more
openly to ruin her Commerce and her Naval power, by seizing
English ships in his ports, confiscating them and their cargoes,
delivering over their crews to the Inquisition to be burned at
the stake, or consumed by cruel treatment in his dungeons.&nbsp;
Finally, he slily invaded Ireland, in order to wrest it from
England.&nbsp; All this without a declaration of war.&nbsp; Nay!
whilst his Ambassadors were pretending peace and amity.&nbsp; The
English Government was paralysed, and it would seem as if our
Commerce was to have been suppressed, and our very maritime
existence stamped out in blood.&nbsp; England, however, was not
left to a weak, divided, or corrupt Government for defence.&nbsp;
The proud fierce Briton of that day was not slow to take his own
part, or that of his county against any odds.&nbsp; The ships of
Commerce went armed for war, and fearlessly flouted their saucy
flag in the face of the foe, whose Royal Navy, in terror, gave
them generally what Sailors call a wide berth!</p>
<p><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>Patriotic
Nobles, Gentlemen, Merchants, and Adventurers, rallying to their
standard the bold fishermen and sailors of the Western Counties,
at their own expence, fitted out a Volunteer Navy.&nbsp; They
covered the Channel and the Ocean with a swarm of Privateers,
which not only securely defended England, but preyed fearlessly
on the Coast and Commerce of Spain, plundering Churches, sacking
towns, burning or sinking ships, crews and all, making prize of
whatever was worth carrying away, and audaciously putting up to
open auction in our seaports any Great Officer, Noble, or
Merchant, who could find money or friends to pay his
ransom.&nbsp; The tide of blood if not of battle was
turned.&nbsp; Philip was not only frustrated in his object of
Conquest, but became alarmed for his own.&nbsp; His losses were
enormous, and even his military operations in the Low Countries
were seriously embarrassed.</p>
<p>Drake, by his wonderful achievements in the West Indies and
the Pacific, gave the finishing blow.&nbsp; His seizure of three
millions completely crippled Spain.&nbsp; Alva&rsquo;s army was
in mutiny for their pay, and had Drake been allowed to pursue his
own <span class="smcap">bold plan</span>, Philip would have been
driven from the Sea in a month.</p>
<p>These are the men who have founded the greatness of their
Country, and base and ungenerous is the Englishman who, reaping
the fruits of their valour, would withhold from them his tribute
of grateful fame.&nbsp; Instead of that, they have been loaded
with reproach and vituperation&mdash;called pirates! cutthroats!
robbers!&mdash;whilst the atrocities of the Spaniards are
entirely overlooked as if they were legitimate warfare, whereas
our Volunteers with their cruizers were the only <span
class="smcap">defence</span> of their Country, and their acts,
inadequate, but most justifiable <span
class="smcap">retaliation</span>.&nbsp; I have endeavoured to do
them justice, I have summoned them from the dead to speak their
own sentiments, and plead their own cause.</p>
<p>I have essayed also, as a most important task, to remove a
vulgar prejudice, very general on the minds of both parties, and
to do justice to the Catholic Nobility of England, who framed,
and have in every age upheld her liberties and <span
class="smcap">constitution</span> against encroaching Popes and
tyrannical kings.&nbsp; It is a common, almost universal,
political error that the age of Mary and Elizabeth was a mere
struggle between Protestants and Roman Catholics for
ascendancy.&nbsp; Gardiner, the uncompromising persecutor of the
Protestants, who desired to set up the Inquisition, and to
extirpate heresy with fire and sword, was &ldquo;<span
class="smcap">fiercely jealous</span>&rdquo; of the independence
of England, and when the Spanish Ambassador urged the marriage of
Mary with Philip, he told him that Nobles and people were against
the Pope, and against foreign interference of all sorts, that
Mary could not marry Philip without a dispensation from the Pope,
which must be kept secret.&nbsp; The <span
class="smcap">country</span> would not <span
class="smcap">tolerate</span> it.&mdash;(<i>Froude</i>, vi,
119.)</p>
<p>Queen Mary herself told Commendone, the Pope&rsquo;s
messenger, that for the present she was in the power of the
People, of whom the majority mortally detested the Holy See, and
that the Lords of the Council were in possession of vast estates
which had been alienated from the Church, and they feared their
titles might be called in question.&mdash;(<i>Froude</i> vi,
89.&nbsp; Citing letter of Pope Julius III, to Pole).&nbsp; Yet
certainly there was not one Protestant on her Council.&nbsp;
Paget, and he was not a Protestant, was the only man who favoured
the Spanish match.&nbsp; But he was opposed to persecution, and
<a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>would not
permit the Queen to alter the succession.&nbsp; He told Gardiner
that if she should send Elizabeth to the Tower her own life would
not be safe for a single day.&mdash;(<i>Froude</i> vi., 120.)</p>
<p>The nation was unanimous in the dread of a marriage between
their Queen and Philip.&nbsp; They feared that England might then
sink into a Spanish dependency, and have to endure the horrors
inflicted on the Low Countries.&nbsp; They wished to keep their
country isolated and not entangled in the wars of the
continent.&nbsp; They therefore desired that their Queens should
marry with the English Nobility (<i>Froude</i> vi, 92), who were
then as they are now, every way superior in family fortune, the
eminent qualifications of mind or body&mdash;above all in social
and political importance, to any rank or class of men in the
world, many of the great Houses of the Aristocracy being allied
to our Plantagenet kings, the greatest heroes, legislators, and
rulers that ever governed men.</p>
<p>It is true that Protestantism, the right of private judgment,
is favourable to Civil Liberty, as was evident in the struggle of
our Puritan Fathers with the Stuarts.&nbsp; But the principles of
the English Constitution were laid before Protestantism had a
being or a name.&nbsp; Who were the men that wrung from the
tyrant John the <span class="smcap">Great Charter</span> at
Runnemede, and many another after it, and maintained them in
defiance of all the thunders of Rome?&mdash;Who passed the
Statutes of Premunire, of Provisors, of Mortmain, and all the
other Acts for restraining the illegitimate authority of the Pope
and the Clergy, and defending their estates and country against
both Regal and Ecclesiastical Despotism?&nbsp; The Catholic
Nobility of England, who knew well how to distinguish between
their Creed and their Civil Polity, between their duty to their
Church and their duty to their Country, to themselves&mdash;to
Posterity!&nbsp; And so long as that Posterity are worthy of the
great inheritance they have bequeathed to them, so long as
Englishmen shall be capable of appreciating Civil Liberty and the
value of their Constitution, the founders of that Constitution
shall receive their just reward, <span class="smcap">Immortal
Glory</span>!</p>
<p>Where is that Constitution now?&nbsp; Let the Protestant
Parliaments that have legislated during late years, and
regardless of our <span class="smcap">Ancient
Constitution</span>, have delivered over Englishmen to be <span
class="smcap">taxed</span> by boards, without the consent of
Parliament, and to be fined! imprisoned! degraded! ruined! in
their persons, characters, and fortunes, by arbitrary
Magistrates, Councils, and Officials, without <span
class="smcap">Trial by Jury</span>, and who but for the timely
protest and warning of the Judges, would have <span
class="smcap">abolished</span> that great <span
class="smcap">Bulwark</span> of <span class="smcap">Civil
Liberty</span> altogether.&nbsp; Let them answer!&nbsp; Let the
great <span class="smcap">Thaumaturgists</span> who pulled the
strings of these parliamentary puppets, and before whom they
danced, answer!&nbsp; England may some day awake from her torpor,
to examine that legislation, and to ask the <span
class="smcap">question</span>&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Where</span>?&mdash;Then&mdash;What then?</p>
<p>Some people not sufficiently read in the history of those
times, may be startled at the extraordinary nature of the facts
which constitute the action of the Drama; and may consider them
exaggerated, if not altogether improbable.&nbsp; I intended a
National Drama, and I have adhered to history.&nbsp; I shall be
borne out by authority.&nbsp; Those who are well informed, will
recognise in the first Act the actual picture our seaboard
presented at the time.&nbsp; The pious Catholic may feel
scandalized at the treatment of the Pope, and <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>the sack of
Rome by the generals of Charles the Fifth at the head of a
Spanish army.&nbsp; I have not invented the transaction.&nbsp; It
would be impossible to exaggerate its atrocity.&nbsp; And Philip
with all his zeal for his professed religion, so long as it
subserved his ambition, was quite ready to repeat his
father&rsquo;s lesson, if the Pope had trespassed on his
dominion.&nbsp; Further, though he was anxious to have Elizabeth
assassinated, he was entirely opposed to the Bull of
Excommunication, or the Pope&rsquo;s interference in the temporal
government of her kingdom.</p>
<p>With respect to myself and the literary merits of my work, I
am very sensible of the little fame (as small as the emolument)
that can accrue to me.&nbsp; It was not my aim to contest the
palm of genius and eloquence with the great Dramatists of the
age, who with so much talent and success, minister to the
amusement of the Public.&nbsp; My humble effort must be regarded
as a literary experiment&mdash;I was anxious to <span
class="smcap">test</span> whether <span
class="smcap">Truth</span> was not stronger than <span
class="smcap">Fiction</span>, and if so, whether the Drama might
not, in abler hands, become the great Pioneer, if not the
exponent and teacher of history.&nbsp; Secondly, whether it could
not be conducted on <span class="smcap">principles</span> free
from the <span class="smcap">objections</span> which Moralists
now raise against it.&nbsp; I have therefore carefully excluded
everything having a tendency to excite those emotions, which the
wisdom of Philosophers, and the guides of society in every age
have agreed ought to be kept in abeyance.</p>
<p>The Greeks, in timid foresight of the abuse, forbade that
women should appear upon the stage.&nbsp; Without going so far I
have shunned the evil they feared.&nbsp; There is not a love
scene in my Drama, nor anything which could minister to that
dangerous passion.&nbsp; I had a <span class="smcap">higher
aim</span>! to call the attention of my country to the origin and
principles of her greatness; to hold up to her view the valour,
the achievements, the glory of our ancestors; to excite in their
descendants a generous rivalry, and to rouse again the national
pride: the spirit and the patriotism of England.&nbsp; If I shall
have succeeded in this, I shall have attained the summit of my

TRANSFER OF THE TRIDENT.</h2>
<h3>ACT I.</h3>
<h4><span class="smcap">Scene</span> I.&mdash;PLYMOUTH&mdash;A
STREET ALONG THE QUAY.</h4>
<p class="gutsumm"><i>The harbour and ships</i>, <i>sailors
swaggering about with a bold</i>, <i>saucy</i>, <i>defiant
air</i>, <i>richly dressed</i>, <i>displaying a profusion of
silks</i>, <i>gold</i>, <i>and jewelry</i>; <i>their women also
flaunting in rich dresses</i>.&mdash;<i>Enter an English
spy</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">English Spy</span>, (<i>In a serious
musing attitude</i>)&mdash;I have watched this game from its
beginning, when Mary married Philip.&nbsp; With all the might of
Spain and Rome to back her she failed to crush a seeming helpless
girl.&nbsp; The young Nobility, the proud hold chivalry of
England took her part!&nbsp; On high paced steeds they rode her
escort, or thronged her house with levies which shamed the
deserted Court.&nbsp; Where&rsquo;er she moved abroad, the
roaring multitude surged round her, unbonneted to their idol as
she passed.&nbsp; I saw that Church and Spain must lose!&nbsp;
Elizabeth would be Queen at last!&nbsp; (<i>He walks a few steps
with a satisfied air</i>.)&nbsp; When Mary&rsquo;s reign was
closed, what shouts of joy broke from emancipated London!&nbsp; A
pall as black as death seemed lifted off men&rsquo;s souls.&nbsp;
What tables of rejoicing lined the streets!&nbsp; What blazing
bonfires reddened all the walls!&nbsp; Catholic and Protestant
forgot their creeds to hail the rising sun of Liberty!&nbsp; I
said Priests and Monks may plot.&nbsp; There is one only party in
the State.&nbsp; England for herself against the <span
class="smcap">World</span>!&nbsp; So hath it been of yore, so let
it be for ever.&nbsp; No foreign Despot will she ever
brook.&nbsp; (<i>He walks proudly</i>).&nbsp; What experience has
been mine?&nbsp; Poverty!&nbsp; Power!&nbsp; Influence! rare
companions! meeting only in the Monk&mdash;and he a Jesuit, a
Missionary; what lands I have visited, what dangers and hardships
encountered! hunger, thirst, travel, fatigue; frozen in the snows
of Siberia, burnt to a living cinder in the Torrid Zone; perils
by sea and land, the barbarous savage with open violence or
poisoned weapon; still worse the pestilence that walketh in
darkness.&nbsp; All have I endured.&nbsp; (<i>His reverie is
interrupted</i>&mdash;<i>startled by tremendous shouts and cheers
of a violent crowd rapidly approaching</i>).</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Crowd</span>, (<i>behind the
scenes</i>).&nbsp; Hurrah for England!&nbsp; Down with Spain and
her inquisition!&nbsp; Hurrah for the El Dorado!&nbsp; Hurrah for
the General!</p>
<p>(<i>Startled</i>) What terrible hurly, burly now?&nbsp;
Another gust of the rising tempest that is to shake the
nations!</p>
<p class="gutsumm"><i>Enter a turbulent crowd of sailors</i>,
<i>bursting in with a great banner on which is blazoned a ship in
gold</i>, <i>and in similar letters the name</i> &ldquo;<i>El
Dorado</i>,&rdquo; <i>cheering and shouting with violent gestures
and confusion</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Crowd</span>.&nbsp; Hurrah for the Virgin
Queen!&nbsp; Down with Spain and her Inquisition.</p>
<p><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>1st
<span class="smcap">Sailor</span>.&nbsp; The Queen!&nbsp; God
bless her, and give her a good English husband.&nbsp; No foreign
rule here!</p>
<p>2nd <span class="smcap">Sailor</span>.&nbsp; Confusion to
Philip and all Foreigners!&nbsp; England for the English!</p>
<p>3rd <span class="smcap">Sailor</span>.&nbsp; Aye! Aye!
lads.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll keep them out!&nbsp; No landing of the
foe on our coasts.&nbsp; Our cruizers will keep the channel
clear.</p>
<p>4th <span class="smcap">Sailor</span> (<i>with
energy</i>).&nbsp; The Channel&rsquo;s ours!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Spy</span> (<i>aside</i>) No doubt, they
will clear it of everything that carries gold, or other foreign
valuables, without being over particular about their
nationality.</p>
<p class="gutsumm"><i>The chief or general</i>, <i>standing
beside the banner</i>, <i>a tall powerful man</i>, <i>though
young</i>, <i>sunburnt</i>, <i>and weather-beaten</i>, <i>gaudily
dressed as silk</i>, <i>velvet</i>, <i>gold and jewels can make
him</i>.&nbsp; <i>In his broad belt plaited with gold</i>, <i>are
stuck a brace of heavy pistols</i>, <i>richly chased with
silver</i>, <i>and a long dagger hafted with gold and
diamonds</i>.&nbsp; <i>On his head a blue velvet cap with a gold
band</i>.&nbsp; <i>On the velvet</i>, <i>emblazoned with
jewels</i>, <i>a ship with the words</i> &ldquo;<i>El
Dorado</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; <i>He holds forth in his left hand a
large ingot</i>, <i>or bar of gold</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Chief</span>.&nbsp; Look ye here, ye sons
of the Ocean Queen, ye storm-birds that have the daring spirit of
your sea-king race, that love the raging surf, and the mountain
wave when it rolls the highest!&nbsp; Ye of the forward step, and
the ready fist, who wish for a little of this! (<i>holding out
the ingot</i>).&nbsp; (<i>Cheers</i>).&nbsp; Who&rsquo;ll
volunteer for the good ship El Dorado?&nbsp; We don&rsquo;t want
every lubber that may offer, only roaring boys that are not
afraid to board a Spanish galleon without counting the square
feet of her lumbering hull, or the hundreds of her cowardly
crew.&nbsp; The El Dorado has a speedy forefoot, I can tell you;
she can run the Caribs in about a fortnight, and we don&rsquo;t
care who knows the <span class="smcap">When</span> and the <span
class="smcap">Whither</span>, not as much as
one!&mdash;Copper!&mdash;Maravedi! (<i>snapping his
fingers</i>).</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Crowd</span>, (<i>cheering</i>),
Hurrah!&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the talk and no bunkum!&nbsp; We know
you, General.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll follow you to the death.</p>
<p>1st <span class="smcap">Bystander</span>.&nbsp; Who is
he?&nbsp; A gallant bearing and tall!&nbsp; He looks a hero born
for command.</p>
<p>2nd <span class="smcap">Bystander</span>.&nbsp; So he ought to
look; Don&rsquo;t you know him?&nbsp; That&rsquo;s young Lord
&mdash;.&nbsp; (<i>He whispers the name</i>), one of
Elizabeth&rsquo;s early lovers.&nbsp; One of the five hundred
young nobles who rode beside her in defiance of Mary&rsquo;s
wrath.&nbsp; When his idol was insulted at Court, he behaved so
violently that he became a marked man, and the persecution
growing hot, he took to the sea for vengeance on the Spanish
party.&nbsp; Now he sticks to it, you perceive, for something
else, (<i>with a knowing look</i>).</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Chief</span>.&nbsp; Now then! who&rsquo;s
for the free flag and the gold coast?&nbsp; We have already
seventy hands, and want a few to make up a hundred.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s enough of Englishmen to carry any of their
goldships, or any Spanish town in the world.&nbsp; We want
especially the sons of our brave men who have died in Spanish
dungeons, or by fire and faggot!&nbsp; (<i>Shouts of indignation
and hurrah for the General</i>).</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Crowd</span>.&nbsp; Here we are,
General!&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll man your guns for you!&nbsp;
Hurrah!&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll pay them off all old scores!</p>
<p>1st <span class="smcap">Sailor</span>, (<i>in a swaggering
tone</i>.)&nbsp; I have searched the whole coast, from Rio de la
Hacha to San Juan, have been up the Darien and the Bocco del
Torro, I know every creek where a Cruizer can lie like an
Alligator for her prey.</p>
<p>2nd <span class="smcap">Sailor</span>.&nbsp; And I every

<p class="poetry">We&rsquo;re bound for El-Dorado<br />

<p><span class="smcap">Spy</span>, (<i>looking after
them</i>.)&nbsp; A tempting offer! had I not a deeper game upon
the die of Fate, and a loftier stake to play for than all the
gold of the Indies&mdash;the liberty of the world!&nbsp; How many
parts I have filled in social life!&nbsp; A bigot and inquisitor
in Despotic Rome, I saw fierce Bourbon, called the Constable,
rush with hot valour on her wall; I fired the death-shot! saw the
Apostate fall!&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas vain!&nbsp; The mighty wave
swept on resistless.&nbsp; The City of the Caesars and the
Popes&mdash;the twice Mistress of the world&mdash;lay helpless
under the ruffian foe, defiling what fierce Vandal and noble Goth
majestic in strength and courage spared.&nbsp; No place was
sacred.&nbsp; No party safe.&nbsp; The sanctuaries of religion,
the sepulchres of the dead, the very tomb of St. Peter rifled for
their wealth; Guelph and Ghibeline, Priest and Layman, the vilest
trades and callings taxed for contributions when plunder
failed;&mdash;and when the blood-hound scent for gold came to
fault, torture was applied, without respect to rank, or sex, or
age, to wring the last scudo from the prostrate people.&nbsp;
There was a spoil! ten millions of gold! the garnered harvest of
centuries of corruption, the imposts of a taxed world gathered in
one stagnant pool.&nbsp; Offerings of pilgrims, gifts of the
dying; the orphan&rsquo;s patrimony; the widow&rsquo;s dower;
extortions of Ecclesiastical Courts; <span
class="smcap">indulgences</span>; the liquidated value of every
vice, lust and crime! <span class="smcap">bribes</span> for which
Heaven had bartered its joys, and <span class="smcap">hell</span>
had commuted its torments of the damned!&nbsp; The sack of
Imperial Rome! (<i>holding up his hands in dismay</i>) Satanic
Bourbon!&nbsp; Infernal Tempter!&nbsp; Thou knew&rsquo;st the
mystic Solder which alone could weld that Rebel Host, mad with
lust and hunger, discordant, dissolute, through battle, fatigue,
and famine!&nbsp; And hurl the blazing Meteor on the goal of thy
Vengeance and Ambition!&nbsp; I beheld the Holy Father himself a
prisoner in his castle of St. Angelo; his jailors! the Catholics
of Spain.&nbsp; My eyes were opened!&nbsp; I fled from the
Desolation.&nbsp; Before me spread an Earthquake of Republics, a
wreck of Nations.&nbsp; France and Spain had torn the land.&nbsp;
I took refuge in the fleet of Dorea with the Spirits that were
left.&nbsp; Genoa rose at his heroic summons.&nbsp; We proclaimed
the Republic.&nbsp; Yes!&nbsp; I saw that last flame of Italian
Glory!&nbsp; It flickered and went out for ever.&nbsp; Through
the once free cities of Italy I harangued the Infidel&mdash;in
democratic clubs on the <span class="smcap">rights</span> of
Nature&mdash;the Republicans on their <span
class="smcap">laws</span>&mdash;to gather up the broken fragments
of their liberties, and arm against the spoilers of the
land.&nbsp; In Holland I preached freedom through the grim creed
of Calvin, and urged the dull <a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>Flemmings to defend their
Constitutions.&nbsp; I have been <span class="smcap">all</span>
things to <span class="smcap">all</span> men.&nbsp; My single
foe&mdash;Despotic Spain&mdash;My creed, its overthrow.&nbsp; In
England two characters by turns.&nbsp; A conspirator to
assassinate the Queen with fanatics who would deluge the land
with blood, destroy their own and other&rsquo;s freedom, and
yield our glorious Island to a foreign tyrant&mdash;the execrable
Philip.&nbsp; And now I am an agent of the unselfish Patriot,
Walsingham (I would trust none other!)&mdash;to foil this foul
conspiracy, and save my native country from slavery and
ruin.&nbsp; I must to the &ldquo;Blue Anchor&rdquo; to meet this
Arch-plotter for the Church and Philip.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll search
his inmost thoughts.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll sound the very depths of
all his treason!&nbsp; (<i>Exit</i>.)</p>

Bear a hand, Joe Jolly! or Jolly Joe! another measure of that old
Sack.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re an old sack yourself.&nbsp; Ho! here he

(<i>laughter</i>).&nbsp; Ha! Ha! Ha!</p>
<p class="gutsumm"><i>Enter Host</i>, <i>scowling fiercely and
holding out in his right hand menacingly a great tankard of

<p><span class="smcap">Host</span>.&nbsp; I say,
Cut-throat!&nbsp; Belay your damned tongue!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you

this (<i>holding out the tankard</i>) on your head!</p>
<p class="gutsumm"><i>The sailor laughs and holds out by the

<p>2nd <span class="smcap">Sailor</span>.&nbsp; If you did, Joe,
I would, and that quickly too, make a butt of yours.&nbsp; Look

<p><span class="smcap">All</span> (<i>interfering</i>).&nbsp;
Avast there!&nbsp; Enough of that messmates!&nbsp; Here, Jolly,
drink with me!&nbsp; Here, Joe (<i>says another party</i>), drink
with us!&nbsp; Hurrah! old chap!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">English Spy</span> (<i>to his
companion</i>).&nbsp; I made our appointment here, Brother, to
give you an idea of what is going on in the world&mdash;a mighty
revolution&mdash;which I think neither His Majesty of Spain nor
His Holiness yet comprehends, and to show you the character of
our people.&nbsp; You will thus understand with whom you have to
deal.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Foreign Spy</span>.&nbsp; They surprise
and almost frighten me with their fierce demeanour and warlike
defiant air.</p>
<p><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span><span
class="smcap">English Spy</span>.&nbsp; Of that anon.&nbsp; Now,
Brother what of the Great Cause in the Low Countries?&nbsp; There
the struggle is at present.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Foreign Spy</span>, (<i>Slowly and with
emphasis</i>), And there, brother, it is almost ended.&nbsp;
William the silent is silent for ever!&nbsp; (<i>The English spy
starts with surprise</i>).&nbsp; That Arch-Heretic, the Prince of
Orange, is no more!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">English Spy</span>.&nbsp; What?&nbsp; The
Prince of Orange dead!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Foreign Spy</span>, (<i>With bitter
emphasis</i>), Three poisoned bullets did for him, spite of all
his caution!&nbsp; Parma outman&oelig;uvred him.&nbsp; Philip is
at the right game of war now!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">English Spy</span>, (<i>Interested to
excitement</i>), How?&nbsp; How was this, brother?&nbsp; It will
be a thunder clap to Europe!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Foreign Spy</span>.&nbsp; It was
difficult; William was so closely guarded; so many attempts had
failed.&nbsp; He seemed unapproachable.&nbsp; We found the
fitting tool!&nbsp; (<i>He pauses</i>, <i>watching his startled
companion with exultation</i>, <i>then continues</i>).&nbsp;
Balthazzar Gerard, an enthusiast from Burgundy.&nbsp; We fanned
the Bigot-flame, and armed his fiery soul with all the panoply of
Faith the church could give, a Martyr&rsquo;s Crown!&nbsp;
Immediate bliss in Heaven.&nbsp; Philip added earthly honours,
nobility and estates in Spain.&nbsp; Balthazzar swallowed the
baited hook, and counted not the cost!&nbsp; (<i>He pauses</i>,
<i>looking at his deeply interested and astounded
companion</i>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">English Spy</span>, (<i>Eagerly</i>), Pray
go on, Brother!&nbsp; He was seized of course! how did he
proceed, or obtain access?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Foreign Spy</span>.&nbsp; He repaired to
the palace at Delft, petitioned for protection and aid, he
pretended to be a Calvinist whose father was executed, and
himself a fugitive for his religion.&nbsp; The mask was
sufficient, he obtained employment, and was at length received
into the palace.&nbsp; There he watched his opportunity, and as
the Prince was passing through his hall to dinner fired into him
three poisoned bullets.&nbsp; The victim dropped, &ldquo;William
the Silent&rdquo; was no more.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">English Spy</span>, (<i>with emotion</i>),
Villain!&nbsp; He was cut down, or seized, tortured, hung!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Foreign Spy</span>.&nbsp; Quick as his
bullets he bounded from the hall, crossed the court-yard, and
gained the city wall, where aid was ready.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">English Spy</span>, (<i>Hurriedly</i>),
Good God!&nbsp; The perfidious traitor escaped.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Foreign Spy</span>.&nbsp; There, just as
the tiger was about to spring, a strong hand arrested him.&nbsp;
His Spanish title, his broad lands, his order of St. Jago
vanished, and the dread spectre of rack and dungeon rose before
his eyes, but Balthazzar was a hero and accepted death.&nbsp;
They dragged him to the rack, &rsquo;twas vain!&nbsp; They tried
every torture ingenuity could invent, or the wickedness of
Heretics employ to tear from this soldier of the church a
confession of his employees.&nbsp; Balthazzar fixed his eye upon
his Martyr&rsquo;s crown, and pointing to his dislocated limbs,
with grim but triumphant smile, heaved his last breath, said
&ldquo;<i>Ecce Homo</i>,&rdquo; and expired.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">English Spy</span>, (<i>Shocked and
excited</i>), Oh!&nbsp; Brother, this is horrible!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Foreign Spy</span>, (<i>Rather
Surprised</i>), But the end, Brother, justifies the means.&nbsp;
You see the good cause advances!&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis Philip&rsquo;s
most successful warfare; thus Murray in Scotland, Coligny at
Paris, and now the Prince of Orange at Delft have paid the
penalty of heresy.&nbsp; These were only the horns Brother, the
head itself shall be cut off.&nbsp; In England is the very head
of Heresy!&nbsp; She must fall next, and then the Church&rsquo;s
triumph is complete.&nbsp; Philip himself, great as he is, must
bow as kings of yore, and hold the stirrup.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">English Spy</span>, (<i>Aside</i>), This
will do for Walsingham, he&rsquo;ll trap the wolves!&nbsp; (<i>To
his companion</i>), We&rsquo;ll talk of this anon, Brother.</p>

amazed companion</i>).&nbsp; You seem bewildered, Brother, I
thought you should be.&nbsp; Engaged about this serious business,
&rsquo;tis well, you see, to understand the Drama that&rsquo;s
being acted in the world.&nbsp; These are the Actors, not Priests
and Politicians, blind with their own cobwebs, self-wove before
their eyes.&nbsp; What think you of the scene?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Foreign Spy</span>.&nbsp;
Horror-struck&mdash;amazed&mdash;such lawless violence&mdash;such
heaps of Gold and Silver&mdash;altar-plate made common
traffic!&nbsp; Grandees of Spain put up to open auction!&nbsp; It
passes comprehension.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">English Spy</span> (<i>smiling</i>).&nbsp;
Philip knows it all, and cannot help himself.&nbsp; He sees his
Gold-ships captured, or sunk, crews and all&mdash;his merchants
plundered; Cities sacked and churches rifled on his own coast;
His Officers and Nobles sold like slaves by public auction; kept
in chains till ransomed; shuts his eyes and must endure the
affront.&nbsp; (<i>He walks aside with a grim smile</i>, <i>and
triumphant air</i>.&nbsp; <i>Then returns and continues
solemnly</i>.)&nbsp; There is a Crisis now in the affairs of
mankind.&nbsp; Providence re-adjusts his plan to open another
chapter in the course of Destiny.&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a New
Power that rises from the sea, and has its source at Plymouth; to
rule the world, and set the nations free!&nbsp; (<i>He walks
aside eyeing his companion exultingly</i>.)&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve seen
it for some time, and in my waking dreams, this little Isle
expands and fills the Globe, whilst Spain recoils, and shrinks
before it like a burning scroll.&nbsp; (<i>He walks with
triumph</i>&mdash;<i>then slowly</i>, <i>with
emphasis</i>).&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s food for thought, Brother!
(<i>aside</i>)&nbsp; Now for proud Spain&rsquo;s Ambassador, and
learn his plans to murder Queen Elizabeth.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Foreign Spy</span> (<i>serious but
firm</i>).&nbsp; The prospect for the Church is ominous and
gloomy.&nbsp; Still, Brother, we must cut off the Head of
Heresy!&nbsp; Let us be moving, (<i>going</i>).</p>
<p><span class="smcap">English Spy</span> (<i>aside as they go
off</i>).&nbsp; Cut off the Head!&nbsp; Still the power remains
to crush thy Despotism&mdash;the stone to strike the Image, and
crumble it to dust!&nbsp; (<i>Exeunt</i>).</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Scene</span> IV.&mdash;A ROOM IN THE
PALACE.</h4>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>Enter the</i> <span
class="smcap">Queen</span> <i>and the</i> <span
class="smcap">Earl of Leicester</span>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Leicester</span> (<i>laughing</i>).&nbsp;
Ha-Ha-Ha!&nbsp; I cannot see it.&nbsp; Excommunicated!&nbsp; How
is it possible?&nbsp; Even the Pope cannot put one out of his
house who never was in it.&nbsp; Ha! Ha! Ha!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a
joke.&nbsp; Excommunicated indeed!&nbsp; Because a fellow like a
thief in the night nails a paper on the Bishop of London&rsquo;s
door, your Majesty is to be deprived of your throne and
life.&nbsp; All the world knows the Statue of
Premunire.&mdash;(<i>with emphasis and deliberation</i>) No Bull
can be published here without the licence of the Crown.&nbsp;
This is poor thunder from the Vatican.&nbsp; Not thus did Leo
roar, and yet a German Monk laughed him to scorn, burned his Bull
in the open Market-place, and <a name="page16"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 16</span>challenged him to prove his title
before the Christian world.&nbsp; Ha! Ha! Ha!&nbsp; (<i>He walks
about laughing</i>&mdash;<i>then comes up to the</i> <span
class="smcap">Queen</span> <i>sarcastically</i>) Pius the Fifth
is no Hildebrand, his wretched missive thus stolen into the
kingdom is no more than waste paper.&nbsp; The thunder of the
Seven Hills has lost the bolt.&nbsp; Ha! Ha! Ha!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Queen</span>.&nbsp; By the Rood, Robin, I
agree with you; It is an insolent joke (<i>She laughs to herself
grimly</i>).&nbsp; The world begins to see it too.&nbsp; France
contemptuously suppressed his Bull, Philip forbade him to issue
it and refuses to permit its publication in his dominions,
(<i>with proud defiance</i>) I have answered his insolence in my
own way, by hanging up his messenger at the very door where he
committed the offence.&nbsp; Ha! Ha! Ha!&mdash;He&rsquo;ll carry
no more messages.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Leicester</span>.&nbsp; Well!&nbsp; Is
there one Catholic Nobleman in England who did not acquiesce in
the execution of Felton?&nbsp; Parliament too gave a quick and
substantial reply, by passing an immediate act, without a
dissentient voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;That to affirm by word or writing
that the Queen is not Queen, or not entitled to the Crown, or
that any other person ought to be Queen, even without an overt
act, shall be High Treason.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Queen</span>.&nbsp; And the Nation
indignant, shouted its assent.&nbsp; I plant my throne, Leicester
in the hearts of my people!&nbsp; They are the true foundation of
all Political right.&mdash;They are my Guards!&nbsp; My bulwark!
my support!&mdash;I did not wait for an Act of Parliament to hang
Felton.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Leicester</span> (<i>rubbing his hands and
laughing</i>).&nbsp; No!&nbsp; No!&nbsp; Your father&rsquo;s
daughter for that!&nbsp; It was a masterly counter-thrust for
him.&nbsp; I should like to see the Pope&rsquo;s face when he
considers your position.&nbsp; (<i>He walks musing</i>, <i>then
confronts the</i> <span class="smcap">Queen</span>) Here you
stand an excommunicated Princess; entirely unscathed by his
thunder.&nbsp; Your throne is as firm as the primeval rock.&nbsp;
You hold prisoner Mary, that was Queen of Scotland, the Dowager
Queen of France, the Representative of Papal claims upon the
throne.&nbsp; Yet not one member of the Catholic Nobility is
ready to do the behests of the Pope in regard to your life or
title.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Queen</span>.&nbsp; And the people! the
Great English people! the fearless! the free!&nbsp; Are they not
more enthusiastic than ever?&nbsp; When do I show myself among
them that they do not crowd around me with the idolatry of
devotion, proud to kiss the hem of my robe, or touch the horse
that bears me.&nbsp; Woe to the assassin who should lift a
finger!&nbsp; He would be torn limb from limb.&nbsp; Yes! Yes!
Leicester, I am safe among my People (<i>she walks about
confidently then stands and passionately continues</i>)&nbsp;
They know I love them, and will never betray their liberties or
their honour (<i>walking aside with emotion</i>).</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Leicester</span>.&nbsp; You are the only
Sovereign in the world that can freely move abroad without other
guards than the people.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Queen</span>.&nbsp; The Catholics of
England never did, and never will, acknowledge the power of the
Pope to annul their liberties, or to interfere in the government
of their country.&nbsp; They will hear the Mass, but they will
have none of his Bulls.&nbsp; They have had too much of
Ecclesiastical Courts, and Appeals to Rome.&nbsp; That question
was decided long ago, when the Clergy tried to substitute the
Canon for the Common Law, and Parliament and People proclaimed
with one voice &ldquo;We will not have the Laws of England
changed&rdquo; (<i>she walks with a triumphant air</i>).</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Leicester</span>.&nbsp; The Court of Rome
takes credit for great cunning and deep policy.&nbsp; Their
present folly does surprise me; to threat without the power to
strike.&nbsp; On whom does it rely?&nbsp; On France or
Spain?&nbsp; Neither could permit the other to attack us, and
concert is impossible &rsquo;twixt elements ajar.</p>
<p><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span><span
class="smcap">Queen</span>.&nbsp; They both are suing me for
favours and alliance.&nbsp; Nay! every Power in Europe.&mdash;I
am the Arbitress of Nations.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Leicester</span> (<i>fiercely</i>).&nbsp;
Besides!&nbsp; Our Naval heroes boldly say, their fleets combined
could never land an army on our shores, and if they could,
England like one man would rise and dash invasion from her!&nbsp;
(<i>He walks exultingly aside</i>).</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Queen</span>.&nbsp; I believe it all,
Leicester.&nbsp; My faith is in my country!&nbsp; In my
people!&nbsp; Nor would their Queen in such an hour be
wanting.&nbsp; Elizabeth would lead the van with them to conquer,
or with them to fall.&nbsp; (<i>She walks with a fierce and
triumphant air</i>)&nbsp; Yet, Leicester!&nbsp; Though with
thoughts like these my Lion spirit rises to the occasion, there
are times when sadness sits brooding o&rsquo;er me, and in the
lone, darkness of my soul, kindred and goblin forms arise, the
brood of melancholy to fright my woman weakness.&nbsp; William,
Prince of Orange, butchered in his Palace! the loaded pistol! the
assassin&rsquo;s knife! ever at one&rsquo;s defenceless
breast&mdash;Ah! Leicester (<i>she shudders with horror</i>)
&rsquo;tis too much to bear! too much! too much! (<i>she weeps
and turns aside with great emotion</i>, <span
class="smcap">Leicester</span> <i>approaching her with deep
sympathy</i>, <i>and kneeling</i>, <i>kisses her robe</i>, <i>to
which he timidly ventures to apply his lips</i>).</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Leicester</span>.&nbsp; My honoured
Mistress!&nbsp; My beloved Queen!&nbsp; God, who raised you up
His chosen instrument, has hitherto supported, and will preserve
you.&nbsp; (<i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Queen</span> <i>turns
abruptly and surprised</i>).</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Queen</span>.&nbsp; What, Robin!&nbsp;
This from thee?&nbsp; Art thou turned Puritan, man?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Leicester</span>.&nbsp; Of late, my Queen,
I have had dreams!&nbsp; Visions of Prophetic import, which seem
to touch the times.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Queen</span>.&nbsp; Dreams!&nbsp; Dreams
that touch the times, belong to anxious brains like mine,
troublous as my checkered life, with danger and alarm.&nbsp;
Thine are of thyself, of love and selfish gain, intrigues with
traitor wenches of my Court that pay me hollow homage, and take
the pay of France, or Philip, or the Queen of Scots, or even
thyself!&nbsp; (<i>Looking at him piercingly</i>).</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Leicester</span>, (<i>attempting to
speak</i>).&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp; My loved Mistress!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Queen</span> (<i>interrupting him</i>),
Nay!&nbsp; Nay!&nbsp; Ne&rsquo;er deny it, Leicester.&nbsp; I
watch the games of all, and play my own! (<i>with a grim
smile</i>).</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Leicester</span> (<i>earnestly</i>, <i>as
to repel the insinuation</i>).&nbsp; My Liege, my thoughts are
capable of proof.&nbsp; The vision long hath left my brain, and
found material body.&nbsp; Art hath moulded it in jewelled gold,
and given it tongue prophetic!&nbsp; Futurity will unfold the
truth; but it would be presented to you on the throne.&nbsp; May
it please your Majesty to be seated.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Queen</span>.&nbsp; What mean you,
man?&nbsp; Robin!&nbsp; No mummery now, my mood is serious!&nbsp;
(<span class="smcap">Leicester</span> <i>bows solemnly</i>),
Well!&nbsp; Well!&nbsp; I will indulge you.&nbsp; (<i>She gives
him her hand and he leads her to the throne</i>).</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Leicester</span>.&nbsp; My Liege!&nbsp; It
is behind the arras, permit me to introduce it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Queen</span> (<i>impatiently</i>).&nbsp;
Do as thou listest and be quick.&nbsp; (<i>He goes for the
intended present</i>).&nbsp; There&rsquo;s something in it, else
he&rsquo;s acting well.&nbsp; What can it be?</p>
<p class="gutsumm"><i>He returns with a splendidly gilt and
ornamented box</i>, <i>lays it down</i>, <i>and opening it</i>,
<i>withdraws a group of statuary of jewelled gold</i>.&nbsp;
<i>Approaching the throne</i>, <i>he kneels on one knee</i>,
<i>and presents it to the</i> <span class="smcap">Queen</span>,
<i>who all the time watches the proceeding with intense
interest</i>, <i>then takes the present with great surprise and
curiosity</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Leicester</span>.&nbsp; Behold, my
Liege!&nbsp; The symboled future!&nbsp; May the God of England
verify it soon.</p>
<p class="gutsumm"><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

curiously</i>, <i>not without awe</i>, <i>as if something
supernatural</i>.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Leicester</span>,
<i>still kneeling</i>, <i>watches her askance</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Queen</span> (<i>slowly</i>).&nbsp;
Magnificent! sublime!&nbsp; Art indeed, which can embody thought
in gold, and almost shape the lips to speech.&nbsp; Prophetic
Vision!&nbsp; Symboled future, humph!&nbsp; The future still to
me is mystic, dark, and awful.&nbsp; (<i>She looks around for</i>
<span class="smcap">Leicester</span>, <i>who is still kneeling
before the throne and watching the</i> <span
class="smcap">Queen</span> <i>with great anxiety
askance</i>).&nbsp; No more of that play-acting; up man, and
expound thy riddle.&nbsp; (<span class="smcap">Leicester</span>

<i>whilst he points with the other to the figures</i>, <i>thus
explains their meaning</i>, <i>the</i> <span
class="smcap">Queen</span>, <i>anxiously awaiting the
result</i>).</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Leicester</span>.&nbsp; The central
figure, seated on a throne, with features so beautiful, the
express image of Majesty itself, is the Queen of England! the
likeness unmistakeable.&nbsp; At her feet kneeling, is the
so-called Queen of Scots.&nbsp; Around the stormy ocean your
bulwark, strength, and power.&nbsp; On either side, figures of
France and Spain overwhelmed in the waves, whilst Neptune, rising
in front, presents to you the globe, and does homage to the true
Sovereign of the seas.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Queen</span>.&nbsp; Oh Leicester!&nbsp;
Leicester!&nbsp; (<i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Queen</span>

<h3><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>ACT
II.</h3>
<h4><span class="smcap">Scene</span> I.&mdash;THE HARBOUR OF SAN
JUAN DE ULLOA.</h4>
<p class="gutsumm"><i>It is surrounded by high cliffs with
batteries</i>.&nbsp; <i>An Island at the mouth</i>.&nbsp;
<i>Spanish and English ships</i>.&nbsp; <i>The town</i>.&nbsp;
<i>Deck of the</i> &ldquo;<i>Jesus</i>&rdquo; <i>of
Lubeck</i>.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Sir John Hawkins</span>,
<span class="smcap">Drake</span>, <span
class="smcap">Hampton</span>, <span
class="smcap">Bolton</span>.&nbsp; <i>A Council of War</i>.&nbsp;
<i>Thunder</i>!&nbsp; <i>Lightning</i>!&nbsp; <i>Tempest</i>!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>.&nbsp; Comrades, we may
well thank God for this refuge.&nbsp; We had a narrow escape in
that gale.&nbsp; I thought the &ldquo;Jesus&rdquo; of Lubeck
would never weather it.&nbsp; Our voyage has been prosperous
beyond expectations.&nbsp; Above a million and a half netted,
with four hundred Negroes still on hands.&nbsp; To have left it
all behind, with our bodies to the sharks, in the Gulf of Mexico,
would have been a calamity.&nbsp; Now with our freight of
enormous value, even if we were rid of our remaining Negroes, we
could not move till we refit.&nbsp; This old hulk in her present
condition, would never float to England.&nbsp; Besides, the
possibility of falling in with a Spanish fleet&mdash;our canvas
in rags, and spars in this state.&nbsp; Weigh it well,
comrades!&mdash;Weigh it well.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Bolton</span>.&nbsp; This is the very spot
for us; we ride here in safety.&nbsp; Neither wind nor sea can
touch us.&nbsp; And we are masters of the place.&nbsp; Our guns
on the island command the entrance, the town is at our own mercy,
the fortified heights are in our hands; we could sink the whole
Navy of Spain in five minutes.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Drake</span>.&nbsp; I should be very sorry
to see the whole Navy of Spain for the present.&nbsp; There are
twelve first-rate ships here, and two hundred thousand pounds
worth of gold and silver in them, which with what we have already
made, and our pearls, emeralds, and precious metals, would be a
goodly return&mdash;say something like two millions.&nbsp; It
would give us some weight in our native country!&nbsp; Heh!&nbsp;
(<i>He walks about with a smile</i>, <i>as they stare at him
excited</i>) Why Old England has not seen the like.&nbsp; How
jolly Plymouth would shout with all her Tars.&nbsp; By St.
George, I think I see the uproar when they should behold our
Gallant Navy riding in the Sound.&nbsp; (<i>He looks at them as
they gaze in excitement</i>&mdash;<i>even</i> <span
class="smcap">Hawkins</span> <i>is surprised</i>)&nbsp; It is a
great temptation!&nbsp; Philip might threaten.&nbsp; Cecil might
grumble and make notes; the Jesuits might plot; but England and
our noble Queen would look at us with other eyes.&nbsp; I say,
take the treasure and the ships; put the town to ransom; and let
us be off!&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t like the look of the place.&nbsp;
Delays are dangerous.&nbsp; Action! action! for me.&nbsp; I hate
Spain and her people.&nbsp; Treachery, perfidy, and cruelty make
up the mind and character of a Spaniard.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>.&nbsp; Hitherto we have
acted within law, and under treaty, solemnly made between Spain
and England.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Drake</span>.&nbsp; I have no faith in and
treaty or peace subsisting between the nations (<i>He comes up
to</i> <span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>, <i>looks at him archly
in the face</i>.&nbsp; <i>All observing with great interest</i>)
Why man, you forget the small exchange of national amenities just
before our departure.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hawkins</span> (<i>laughing</i>) Oh! you
allude to that Spanish ship which&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Drake</span> (<i>interrupting with comical
seriousness</i>) I mean the Spanish man-of-war, with Flemish
prisoners, who came for shelter into Plymouth Harbour.&nbsp; You
fired upon her with the Castillian flag at her main; made <a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>her haul down
her colours, and deliver up her prisoners, which you sent home to
fight against Spain.&nbsp; You remember the stir Philip made
about it, and when the Queen sent you an angry message (Lord, she
never meant it&mdash;a mere blind) you audaciously told her that
you deserved her thanks for maintaining the honour of the country
(<i>laughter</i>).&nbsp; You know we sailed under the protest of
De Silva and have carried on our trade by force of arms.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Bolton</span>.&nbsp; We could not venture
to sea without repairs.&nbsp; We want at least a week.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hampton</span>.&nbsp; Oh! we could soon
victual&mdash;seize the ships, levy contributions, put the town
to ransom, and make sail.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>.&nbsp; But then, you see
the Treaty.&nbsp; What would the Council say?&nbsp; What would
Cecil say?&nbsp; He is against us as it is.&nbsp; Besides, the
legitimate trade we are carrying on&mdash;a million! in a single
voyage.&nbsp; This in my opinion is better than booty and open
war.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Drake</span>.&nbsp;
Treaty!&mdash;Peace!&mdash;Legitimate trade!&mdash;Hawkins
don&rsquo;t deceive yourself; bits of paper cannot disguise the
virulent hostility subsisting between Spain and England.&nbsp;
The legitimate trade we are carrying on in ships armed to the
teeth!&nbsp; It is nothing but open war&mdash;a defiance of
Philip and his power.&nbsp; Talk of the Council being against us,
and what Cecil may say.&nbsp; (<i>Contemptuously</i>).&nbsp;
Cecil! who can see no other way to keep up our Navy than an Act
of Parliament to compel the Protestant People of England to eat
fish.&nbsp; Ha! Ha! Ha! (<i>laughter in which the crews
join</i>.&nbsp; <i>With emphasis</i>).&nbsp; Bluff King Hal and
his Parliament, thought Beef at a farthing a pound was the right
way to keep up the stout hearts and strong arms of Englishmen,
who themselves have ever been the true and only defence of their
Country and Freedom.&nbsp; (<i>He walks aside
indignant</i>.&nbsp; <i>Laughter</i>&mdash;<i>caught up and
echoed back with tremendous cheers by the sailors around and
below decks</i>).&nbsp; Whenever Britons, in sloth and ignorance
shall delegate their duty to a Council, or a Government, they
will forfeit their high Destiny&mdash;their Commission from on
High!&mdash;Their safety and their Liberties will sink together
in the dust of Rottenness, and the proud Island of the Brave and
Free, remain only a bleak, deserted, and ruined rock amid the
breakers, a monument of the past; a warning to the future, like
Tyre and Carthage, and Great Rome herself.&nbsp; England can only
fall through treason and corruption.&nbsp; (<i>Cheers from the
sailors and shouts</i>).</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Sailors</span>.&nbsp; May God defend us
from that.&nbsp; We can defend us from our enemies ourselves,
Hurrah!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>.&nbsp; The Jesus is a
wreck, can scarcely float, her mainmast sprung&mdash;she could
not go to sea.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Drake</span>.&nbsp; Abandon her
then.&mdash;Here are plenty of ships fit for a voyage, with
treasure in them.&nbsp; Take your choice, burn the rest, and make
sail with what we have.&nbsp; Put no faith in Spaniards.&nbsp;
They will consider the treaty as so much waste paper, when it
serves their ends to do so.&nbsp; They fear and hate us, and
neither bonds nor treaties will stop them in their
vengeance.&nbsp; Our only treaty to rely on is in ourselves when
we are too strong for them&mdash;God grant it may ever be
so&mdash;or woe to Merry England.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>.&nbsp; Abandon the
Jesus!&nbsp; You forget that she is the Queen&rsquo;s
ship&mdash;the only one in the expedition.&nbsp; Do you know the
temper of our good Queen?&nbsp; She will expect her ship back,
and also her share of the profit.&nbsp; What if, instead, I
should bring the Kingdom under heavy demands from Philip for our
infraction of the Treaty; I ask you, do you know her temper, or
what her Royal and gentle Majesty would say?&nbsp; Heh!</p>
<p><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span><span
class="smcap">Drake</span> (<i>laughing as at a joke</i>).&nbsp;
Fire and Steel!&nbsp; I should think I did, Ha! Ha! Ha!&nbsp; I
know our Royal Mistress well.&nbsp; Her Majesty is a good
Protestant, but she has two idols set up in her heart, whose
worship she will never abandon for any other creed,
&ldquo;ambition and avarice;&rdquo; the love of power, and the
love of gold.&nbsp; Give her these, what cares she for an old
hulk.&nbsp; Let her know that her heroes can sweep the seas, that
we defy, and soon shall break the force of haughty Spain.&nbsp;
Above all, drench her with gold and show me the power on earth
that can drag it from her.&nbsp; (<i>He walks aside with his
hands up</i>).&nbsp; She will swallow man the gold of the Indies,
but believe me, disgorge it, never.&nbsp; Temper!&nbsp; Fire and
Steel!&nbsp; I think I see her temper on the receipt of a
dispatch from Philip, that clerk king, whose sceptre is his pen
with which he dooms brave men to death, and nations to slavery,
whilst he himself, the veriest slave to Monks and Priests,
delegates the authority of his high office to what he calls the
Holy House of the inquisition.&nbsp; Restitution forsooth!&nbsp;
What she would say!&nbsp; &ldquo;God&rsquo;s death,&rdquo; she
would exclaim, &ldquo;Is the fellow a fool, to ask me for
money?&nbsp; Let him catch Hawkins and Drake, and the rest of the
freebooters himself, and take what satisfaction he can out of
them.&rdquo;&nbsp; That is pretty much what she would say.&nbsp;
But if he should come himself to demand it, I think she would be
very likely to box his Royal ears for him, and tell him to go and
be hanged, as she did the stout Earl of Essex, when he had the
impudence to turn his back upon her.&nbsp; (<i>Laughter</i>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>.&nbsp; This is bold advice,
Drake, but I do not like the responsibility.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Drake</span>.&nbsp; Responsibility!&nbsp;
To whom?&nbsp; To our Queen?&nbsp; She will hold us responsible,
only for failure in our enterprise.&nbsp; In plain words, for
bringing home no money.&nbsp; Besides, she has no jurisdiction
here, nor are we sailing under her flag, or the authority of a
Lord High Admiral, or his Court.&nbsp; We Rovers sail under our
own red bunting, acknowledging no Courts; and fight our way, not
palter about Treaties.&nbsp; Law cannot defend us; should the
Spaniards but get us into their clutches, would they vouchsafe to
us, trial in a lawful court?&nbsp; No!&nbsp; We should have
neither law nor mercy.&nbsp; The Inquisition!&nbsp; Torture! the
Auto-de-fe, that is fire and faggot, would be our lot.&nbsp; For
my part, I will acknowledge no responsibility, but to God, upon
His own ocean!&nbsp; So long as I live, I shall consider it my
best duty to him, to make war upon Spaniards, who are alike his
enemies and ours.&nbsp; Is that monster Philip without other
motive than the impulse of a cruel nature, to sit unopposed in
his cabinet like a spider weaving his webs of slavery for
mankind, to monopolise the earth&rsquo;s surface with all the
gold in its bosom, and the whole ocean as well?&nbsp; Why not its
circumambient air, that we may ask his leave to breathe?&nbsp; I
tell you, Hawkins, that whilst I can muster a keel, and men and
Britons to man it, I shall ask no licence from mortal man; I
shall boldly take my share of its wild waves, in spite of all the
Despots in the world, and claim it as my patrimony from
God!&nbsp; (<i>He turns away in great excitement</i>.)</p>
<p class="gutsumm"><i>The report of a solitary gun booms along
the water</i>, <i>and cuts short the debate</i>.&nbsp; <i>They

BATTERIES COMMANDING THE MOUTH OF THE HARBOUR.</h4>
<p class="gutsumm"><i>The Spanish fleet of thirteen sail</i>,

<p style="text-align: center">Enter Sir <span class="smcap">John
Hawkins</span>, <span class="smcap">Drake</span>, <span
class="smcap">Hampton</span>, <span class="smcap">Bolton</span>,
and others.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Spanish Ambassador</span>.&nbsp; Have I
the honour to address the great, invincible and renowned, Sir
John Hawkins, whose fame is throughout the world?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>.&nbsp; Your excellency has
before you the Admiral and the gallant Captains of a small
English fleet, bound on a trading voyage, put in under stress of
weather, to victual and re-fit; and for our own security, during
the time we find it necessary to occupy the harbour, we intend to
prevent the entry of armed vessels.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Ambassador</span> (<i>amazed</i>).&nbsp;
But we are the fleet of His Majesty the King of Spain, carrying a
thousand soldiers, thirteen galleons with others their consorts
and tenders.&nbsp; I have the honour to be his Ambassador, and
this is his viceroy, with authority to govern his possessions in
the New World.&nbsp; Allow me to present to you Don Martini
Henriqnez, viceroy of all the Indies.&nbsp; (<i>Hawkins
bows</i>.)&nbsp; This is His Majesty&rsquo;s town and dominions,
and we claim not only free entrance, but entire
jurisdiction.&nbsp; The nations are at peace, and we concede to
you the right freely to occupy it as friends, to trade and
re-fit, with freedom of departure.&nbsp; What would you more?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>.&nbsp; True, your
Excellency, the nations are nominally at peace, but we Englishmen
have been in these times of peace treated as worse than enemies
in war.&nbsp; We have been attacked by ships carrying the
Castillian flag, thrown into prison, tortured, famished in
dungeons, given over to the inquisition, to fire and faggot,
contrary to the law of nations, and to actual treaty.&nbsp; We
must take care of ourselves.&nbsp; Either you shall force an
entrance at the cannon&rsquo;s mouth, which you will not find a
very easy matter, or you enter on such conditions as I shall
dictate.&nbsp; That we have liberty to trade, victual, and
re-fit, and to depart without hindrance or molestation, that the
fortifications remain in our hands, and that you give hostages,
as a guarantee for their fulfillment.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Ambassador</span>.&nbsp; This, Senor, is a
very serious matter.&nbsp; It is against law, reason, and justice
that we should be under conditions imposed by a foreigner who has
no claim or authority here, to enter our own possessions.&nbsp; I
do not know how I should answer to my Royal Master, should I so
far compromise his authority and right, conceding to a stranger,
the privilege of dictating conditions to our ships in our own
waters.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>.&nbsp; Nor I to answer to
my Royal Mistress for the loss of her ships and men by any laxity
or cowardice on my part in not defending them.&nbsp; We
Englishmen are accustomed to consider our duty to our country
paramount over all else, to fight under the national flag till
Death or Victory; never to yield a point in debate or battle, but
to stick to our guns, and No Surrender!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">English All</span>.&nbsp; No
Surrender!&nbsp; No Surrender!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>.&nbsp; Your Excellencies,
and you Senores, you see your choice.&nbsp; Either you fight or
depart, or enter on our conditions.</p>
<p><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span><span
class="smcap">Ambassador</span>.&nbsp; I shall retire if you
please, and consult with his Excellency.&nbsp; (<i>Exeunt
Spaniards</i>.&nbsp; <i>English laughing</i>).</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hawkins</span> (<i>laughing</i>).&nbsp;
Well, Comrades, I think I have settled their Excellencies; what
think you?&nbsp; They must be off.&nbsp; If they meant fighting,
they would have boldly entered like men, and asked no one&rsquo;s
leave.&nbsp; They dare not enter into conditions.&nbsp; Philip
would execute them all, and rightly too, the poltrons.&nbsp; It
would be complete surrender of his authority.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hampton</span>.&nbsp; It is not long you
would have hesitated with such a fleet, General!&nbsp; I think
with you, they will be off if the gale will allow them to weather
the headlands.&nbsp; Lord! you frightened them; they turned pale
at your very look.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the way to talk to
them.&nbsp; No backing and filling; no hauling of tacks and
sheets with Spaniards.&nbsp; A straight course, good headway;
with half a gale blowing.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what they
can&rsquo;t stand.&nbsp; (<i>He walks aside haughtily</i>).</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Bolton</span>.&nbsp; General, you have
spoken like a Tar, and an Englishman.&nbsp; I call that sailing
to half a point of the compass.&nbsp; (<i>Turning to</i> <span
class="smcap">Hampton</span>).&nbsp; I am like you, Hampton, for
carrying all sail, and keeping the red flag flying.&nbsp; Damn
their thirteen ships and their new Viceroy Don Martini Henriquez,
too, with his thousand soldiers.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s all that to
us?&nbsp; We can soon settle accounts with them, and their
odds.&mdash;I never once thought of counting the number of
Spaniards or Frenchmen, or of their ships either.&nbsp; Before we
shall have sunk or burned the half of them, it will be very
difficult to find the other half.&nbsp; We are not only a match
for them on the open sea, but here they are at our mercy, keep
them out, and then the gale will do for them.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Drake</span>.&nbsp; Well said, Old Rough
and Ready, you know how to deal with Spaniards.&nbsp; If you
trust them, Hawkins, you will rue it all your life.&nbsp;

<p class="gutsumm"><i>The Spaniards during the night have got
possession of the batteries on the heights</i>, <i>filled with

<span class="smcap">Bolton</span>, and <span
class="smcap">Hampton</span>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>.&nbsp; Comrades!&nbsp; This
harbour of San Juan de Ulloa wears a different face this morning
from that it bore when we last surveyed its beauties from this
deck; and doubtless inspires you all with altered feelings.&nbsp;
With what hope we entered it, as the last waves of the angry sea
broke vainly in our wake, and when we dropped anchor, our
shattered barks rode easy as seagulls on the waters of the
peaceful bay.&nbsp; We congratulated ourselves on our escape from
danger&mdash;on the profits of a successful voyage&mdash;and we
surveyed the beauteous landscape in comfort and security.&nbsp;
How vain the dream!&nbsp; How changed the reality!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Bolton</span>.&nbsp; Glad as I was then,
General, of its friendly shelter, I would rather the fiercest
gale that ever howled its threats in the open ocean, than behold
that thunder-cloud gathering over our heads (<i>he points to the
batteries</i>).&nbsp; How did they get possession of these
forts?</p>
<p><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span><span
class="smcap">Hawkins</span>.&nbsp; Our men, deceived by
pretended friendship, cajoled by favour, and seduced by the
fascinations of the Creole women, have been allured into the
town.&nbsp; During the night the enemy seized the batteries.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Drake</span> (<i>looking towards the
town</i>).&nbsp; They are reaping the bitter fruits of
disobedience now, or I am much mistaken.&nbsp; (<i>Shouts</i>,
<i>tumult</i>, <i>and confusion of a multitude intermingled with
shots and cheers come from the shore</i>.)&nbsp; Hark to
that!&nbsp; It is an English cheer and an angry one!&nbsp; It
cuts sharp and clear like the tone of a fife through the roar of
battle.</p>
<p><i>Shouts of</i> <span class="smcap">Sailors on
Shore</span>.&nbsp; Hurrah for Moone!&nbsp; Stick to them boys!
Hurrah!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Drake</span>.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s Moone in
the front; how he wields his axe!&nbsp; He cleaves them like
sheep in the slaughter house.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s big Jack Winter,
with the boat-hook; he handles it as if it were a
quarterstaff.&nbsp; How he scatters the little Spaniards!&nbsp;
Brave boys, lay on!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Bolton</span>.&nbsp; The crowd falls back
before these two men, (<i>great excitement on board the
Jesus</i>).&nbsp; Our fellows have the best of it.&nbsp; They
have gained their boats and are pulling for their ships.&nbsp;
(<i>Shouts continue</i>, <i>the sailors in the boats
hail</i>).</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Sailors in the Boats</span>.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Jesus a-hoy.&rdquo;&nbsp; (<i>The sailors on board begin
to crowd the deck in great excitement and prepare to
cheer</i>).</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>.&nbsp; Hush!&nbsp; No
cheers as you value our safety.&nbsp; Silence!&nbsp; Silence in
the ship!&nbsp; Boatswain, all hands to quarters in
silence.&nbsp; Men to the guns, deck watch, stand by to get under
weigh.&nbsp; (<i>He rushes about to restore order</i>).</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hampton</span>.&nbsp; Could not our
fellows by a sudden charge surprise the forts?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hawkins</span> (<i>With assumed
confidence</i>).&nbsp; It is too late, alas!&nbsp; But I signed
the treaty with an Ambassador of Spain, and with Philip&rsquo;s
Viceroy of all the Indies.&nbsp; We have their honour and the
credit of their nation for its fulfilment.&nbsp; Upon its
conditions I gave them entry into the harbour, and saved them
from destruction.&nbsp; Suppose they have got possession of the
batteries, they are bound to give us safe and peaceable right to
victual and re-fit, with freedom of departure.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Drake</span>.&nbsp; Oh Hawkins, delusion,
mere delusion!&nbsp; A treaty when you have not the means to
enforce it.&nbsp; There is not a moment to waste.&nbsp;
Action!&nbsp; Action!&nbsp; (<i>With energy</i>) Prepare for
instant battle, or it will be every way too late.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hampton</span>.&nbsp; They are getting
into line with springs on their cables, so that every gun may
bear.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Drake</span>.&nbsp; And the batteries,
they are pointing the guns on us.&nbsp; Look there Hawkins.&nbsp;
You have the weather gage, make for them under all sail; with the
command of the wind, you can give a double broadside.&nbsp; Set
your ship on fire, and run her aboard the Admiral.&nbsp; In the
confusion take to your boats and pull for the Minion.&nbsp; We
shall pepper away, and get to sea.&nbsp; On the blue water our
legs will be too long for them, should they dare to follow
us.&nbsp; Goodbye, God bless you, Hawkins, should we not meet
again, (<i>they shake hands</i>).&nbsp; No surrender.&nbsp;
Victory or death.&nbsp; (<i>Exeunt</i> <span

<h4><span class="smcap">Scene</span> IV.&mdash;THE BATTLE OF SAN
JUAN DE ULLOA.</h4>
<p class="gutsumm"><i>The harbour filled with burning
ships</i>.&nbsp; <i>The Jesus is aboard the Spanish Admiral</i>,

stick to the Admiral.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t let him out clear.&nbsp;
Hurrah! upon bows and guns.&nbsp; (<i>He turns towards the
Minion</i>.)&nbsp; See!&nbsp; They are on the deck of the
Minion.&nbsp; Hurrah for Hampton!&nbsp; Stick to them gallant
tars.&nbsp; Pike, axe, and cutlass, follow me.&nbsp; (<i>He
rushes at their head through the pinnace on to the deck of the
Minion</i>, <i>shouts and cheers as they clamber over the
bulwarks</i>).&nbsp; Hah!&nbsp; Minion to the rescue!&nbsp; Down
with the traitors!&nbsp; Down with the villains, Hah! the axe of
Moone!&nbsp; Great Winter, hurl them overboard with a run.&nbsp;
Brave men, strong men, hurrah for merry England, the day is ours,
God gives us the victory; Hurrah!&nbsp; Hurrah! (<i>with great
eagerness</i>).&nbsp; Look to the deck of the Jesus,
Hampton.&nbsp; How well our men behave.&nbsp; Fire upon the
Admiral, ply shot and shaft.&nbsp; (<i>They shoot</i>) Hah!&nbsp;
The long bow of England against the world.&nbsp; These are the
scorpions that sting our foes.&nbsp; My gallant fellows have done
their work, they are both blazing.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s all up there,
keep the Spaniards in confusion and let our men get away.&nbsp;
(<i>They are crowding into their pinnace and leaping
overboard</i>).&nbsp; Boats and spars for those that are in the
water.&nbsp; (<i>Men run about with spars</i>).</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hampton</span>.&nbsp; Out with the sweeps
and try to crawl ahead, we shall fall in with a cap-full of wind,
once clear of the vibration of the guns.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>.&nbsp; Now serve out the
ale.&nbsp; (<i>Leaning exhausted against the main-mast</i>, <i>he
calls to his cupbearer for Ale</i>).&nbsp; Samuel, fill me a cup
of ale, for my very soul is exhausted, but I thank God for this
deliverance, (<i>his cupbearer hands him a silver goblet</i>,
<i>he comes forward and poises it in the air</i>).&nbsp;
Here&rsquo;s to our Noble Queen and her heroic Tars!&nbsp; (<i>He
quaffs the Ale and lays down the goblet</i>, <i>which a cannon
shot dashes to pieces the moment his hand quits it</i>, <span
class="smcap">Captain Hampton</span> <i>rushing forward to assist
him</i>).</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hampton</span>.&nbsp; Are you hurt,
General?&nbsp; That was a narrow escape, but we are accustomed to
such chances.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>.&nbsp; It was the will of
God, Hampton&mdash;a warning voice to give him the glory.&nbsp;
There is no such thing as chance.&nbsp; He has not done with me
yet.&nbsp; (<i>Look</i>, <i>he looks around.</i>)&nbsp; But we
are all right now.&nbsp; Avast rowing, let us have a view of the
battle-field.&nbsp; Heavens! what a wreck, they are utterly
disabled.&nbsp; (<i>The harbour is strewn with wreck</i>.&nbsp;
<i>The Spanish fleet is blazing</i>; <i>some driven ashore</i>,
<i>some sunk</i>, <i>the masts and flags appearing above
water</i>).</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hampton</span>.&nbsp; The Jesus is burned
to the water-mark, but she has done her work.&nbsp; She has set
fire to the Admiral, the flame has spread.&nbsp; They are all
either destroyed by fire, shot to pieces, or driven ashore.&nbsp;
It is truly marvellous how so small a force should destroy a
powerful fleet like that.&nbsp; You ought to have taken
Drake&rsquo;s advice to seize them with all their arms, ships,
treasure, and batteries of the place; then we should have been
masters of Spain and the Ocean.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>.&nbsp; Let us be
satisfied.&nbsp; You see I was hampered with the Treaty, and our
undetermined, perhaps divided Government.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hampton</span>.&nbsp; Say the traitors in
the Government!&mdash;Damn the Government!&mdash;Damn the
Treaty!&mdash;But as you have said, General, perhaps we should be
satisfied with our lives.&nbsp; There is Drake and the Judith
ahead.&nbsp; Pull away my boys, there is not a breath.&mdash;What
a lull the storm of battle leaves, as if the very Ocean
quailed.&nbsp; Hurrah upon the starboard sweeps!&nbsp; Hurrah!

<p><span class="smcap">Hawkins</span> (<i>melancholy and

or worse, captured, and then the Inquisition, fire and
faggot!&nbsp; Nothing too cruel for Spaniards to
Englishmen.&nbsp; My poor Brother!</p>
<p class="gutsumm"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Sir Henry
Killigrew</span>, <i>who comes up to him unseen</i>, <i>one of
the many nobles and gentry driven to the sea as daring
Buccaniers</i>, <i>by the Marian persecution</i>, <i>now a most
confidential agent of the</i> <span
class="smcap">Queen</span>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Sir Henry Killigrew</span> (<i>clapping
him on the shoulder</i>).&nbsp; Well! old friend, what does the
Telescope say?&nbsp; For I can guess what you are on the look out
for.&nbsp; I came down from London, to have a look myself, and to
have a talk with you about these Spanish ships in port, with
specie.&nbsp; I shall detain them until the result of this affair
is ascertained.&nbsp; The Queen is in a towering rage.&nbsp; You
know her temper when she feels not only that she is injured, but
that her honour and power are slighted.&nbsp; She says this is a
foul business; worse than open war.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>.&nbsp; My poor Brother,
with all his gallant spirit and seamanship, when dealing with the
enemy, was so confident in his crotchets of Law and Treaty!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Killigrew</span>.&nbsp; Law and Treaty
with the Spaniard; that means let him tie your hands until he
cuts your throat and robs you!&nbsp; There is hardly a day
without some demand of redress from Philip, whilst even an answer
is refused to us for the gravest breaches of Law, human and
divine.&nbsp; The state of affairs is ominous.&nbsp; The Council
is divided.&nbsp; Men say the Nation is divided; a foul
falsehood.&nbsp; This affair of the Queen of Scots with the Duke
of Norfolk, the poor fool! an idle threat of rebellion aided by
Spain and the Pope.&nbsp; The Queen hardly knows whom to
trust.&nbsp; Her reliance is on the Privateers, but we had better
retire to talk of these matters.&nbsp; Here comes a suspicious
looking rascal (<i>he looks at him</i>) he walks lame!&nbsp; Yet,
observe, it is only a limp now and then; and that patch over his
eye&mdash;it is only put on for a blind; the fellow does not look
before him, like a man with one eye; yet he has a bold bearing,
and tall.&nbsp; But for the patch and the awkward limp, I should
think I knew the rake of his top-mast.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hawkins</span> (<i>after a view of the
new-comer through his telescope</i>&mdash;<i>laughing</i>) You
know him well.&nbsp; It is bold Tom Cobham, that fought his way
with Wyatt, to the very gates of the Tower.&nbsp; He is after
some devil&rsquo;s play, I&rsquo;ll warrant&mdash;and I think I
know his game; he wears a disguise in Plymouth; there are so many
spies here; he is supposed to be dead, you know.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Killigrew</span>.&nbsp; Of course; it was
given out that he was sentenced to an extravagant
death&mdash;unknown to our laws.&nbsp; It was a trick of the
Queen&rsquo;s.&nbsp; She laughs when she tells how she humbugged
the Ambassador, who took it all in, and actually wrote it to his
master.&nbsp; Elizabeth knew better than to execute one of Lord
Cobham&rsquo;s sons, who so nearly forfeited their lives in her
cause.&nbsp; You know his offence?</p>
<p><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span><span
class="smcap">Hawkins</span>.&nbsp; Yes, Yes! the Spanish ship he
captured, with eighty thousand ducats, in the Bay of Biscay, and
which, after sewing up the Captain and all hands in their sails
for winding sheets, he sent to the bottom!&nbsp; It was cleverly
done, that affair; just like Cobham, who is not the man to do
things by halves where Spaniards are concerned.&nbsp; I marvel
how the thing got wind.&nbsp; When we scuttle a ship, we expect
to hear no more of her: dead men usually tell no tales!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Killigrew</span>.&nbsp; In this case the
adage turned out to be untrue; the westerly swell in
Biscay&rsquo;s shallow waters washed eighteen bodies ashore,
sewed up in the mainsail; they of course were recognized, and the
chase through the chops of the channel was seen by another
Spaniard, who knew Cobham&rsquo;s Sea Eagle before, only too
well!&nbsp; Here he comes; let us affect not to know him!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Cobham</span> <i>passes</i>&mdash;<i>Then
walks round surveying them comically</i>, <i>using his hand as a
telescope</i>, <i>held to his covered eye</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Cobham</span>.&nbsp; I am just taking an
observation before hailing&mdash;you are a pretty pair of
land-lubbers, you are, not to recognize a brother tar and
messmate, who has only to open his mouth to hang you both for
piracy and murder on the high seas; and levying war on Her
Majesty&rsquo;s faithful ally the King of Spain, a hundred
times.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>They all burst into
laughter</i>, <i>with a hearty recognition</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Killigrew</span>.&nbsp; My dear Tom, I am
heartily glad to see you; but we were carrying out your own joke,
man; when you take your next observation, just remember not to
put the glass to the blind eye.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Cobham</span> (<i>laughing</i>).&nbsp;
Good, good, I only show a little false bunting for the occasion,
to pass unnoticed through the crowd.&nbsp; We have a little
business on here, and don&rsquo;t want to draw attention till it
is over.&nbsp; (<i>He takes off the patch</i>).&nbsp; But I find
O cannot do this trick well; Tom Cobham fits better his part in
the rough work of battle.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>.&nbsp; Aye, aye, Tom; you
may as well open the other port.&nbsp; We could recognize your
bold sailing, whatever canvass you should hoist.&nbsp;
What&rsquo;s the game now?&nbsp; I have an idea, these
Antwerp-bound Spaniards, eh!&nbsp; They are here, you know under
the protection of the law.&nbsp; If they are attacked, Philip
will demand redress, and what will the Queen say?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Cobham</span> (<i>indignantly</i>).&nbsp;
Say, Say!&nbsp; Let her say what she ought to say.&nbsp; That the
banner of England has been trailed through the dirt, in the
streets of Madrid, by Public officers in obedience to his own
order, as if he had taken it in battle from the Turk.&nbsp; Her
Majesty&rsquo;s subjects, without having committed other offence
than that of being free born Englishmen, have been tortured,
burned, or famished in inquisition dungeons, and buried like dogs
in dunghills; and all this by royal authority, and during
peace.&nbsp; Peace!&nbsp; There can be no peace between Spain and
England.&nbsp; Talk of protection, does he expect Her Majesty to
became his water bailiff, or to erect an ocean police for
him?&nbsp; As to our Acts, under what responsibility is she for
them?&nbsp; They are our own private Acts.&nbsp; Our ship&rsquo;s
are private property, our crews are volunteers; we sail under our
own flag, and are alone responsible for what we do.&nbsp; Let him
take care of his own by his means, and seize us if he can.&nbsp;
Then it will be scant mercy or justice we shall receive.&nbsp; As
for me, I have never sought to cover myself with my
country&rsquo;s flag; I go forth from my Irish cove under my own
free bunting, I have a mission of blood and vengeance against
Spain and her inquisition, and with the help of God I will never
cease a war of extermination until they are destroyed; and,
Killigrew, there is a continual voice within me which whispers,
&ldquo;The end it near.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span><span
class="smcap">Killigrew</span>.&nbsp; The government thinks it
belongs to them, to demand retribution for the nation, and I can
speak for the Queen; she is resolved.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Cobham</span>.&nbsp; Tush! tush!
government will never do anything.&nbsp; No! the merchants and
sailors must take care of themselves, by self-defence and just
retaliation.&nbsp; It is a private war against robbers and
murderers.&nbsp; Look at this late affair of the five Bristol
briggs at the Azores.&nbsp; The English were getting under weigh
as the Spanish Admiral entered the harbour.&nbsp; It was enough
that they carried St. George&rsquo;s Cross at their main.&nbsp;
He fires upon them, carries their crews to Cadiz in irons, makes
over their property to the Inquisition, confiscates the ships,
and throws the men into prison to rot like thousands of their
fellows, in hopeless dungeons!&nbsp; (<i>He walks aside
indignant</i>).</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Killigrew</span>.&nbsp; Well, but it is
under negociation.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Cobham</span>
(<i>sarcastically</i>).&nbsp; Negociation with the Inquisition,
over whose holy house Philip says he has no control, (<i>a bitter
laugh</i>.)&nbsp; No, no! the murderers must be put down as the
people of St. Malo put them down.&nbsp; The Spanish Inquisition
burned at the stake, sixty French sailors from St. Malo,
notwithstanding Philip&rsquo;s entreaty to the contrary.&nbsp;
The French manned their pinnaces, looked out for Spaniards,
captured one hundred and sent their heads into Spain, leaving one
man in every vessel to steer her into port, and show inquisitors
the fell retribution of their bloody work!&nbsp; (<i>He walks
exultingly</i>).&nbsp; The Spanish Inquisition has meddled no
more with French sailors.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>.&nbsp; All true, about our
affair at the Azores.&nbsp; I know merchants in Plymouth, who
were owners in the ships.&nbsp; Now about these Spanish ships in
port, what?&nbsp; You see they have taken refuge from those
sea-hawks outside and from some that are inside, or I&rsquo;m
mistaken.&nbsp; What is that low black, snake-like lugger, with
her anchor just atrip, like a greyhound in the leash?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Cobham</span> (<i>with a malicious
smile</i>).&nbsp; She is a fishing-boat of mine, with fifty hands
in her, ready to make sail the moment the Spaniards move.&nbsp;
And those Clippers outside are the sea-hawks of the best blood in
England, driven by persecution and tyranny, to the liberty of the
ocean.&nbsp; There is ruffling Ned Horsey, Strangway, well known
as the Red Rover of the Channel, Carew&rsquo;s, Tremaine&rsquo;s,
Throgmorton&rsquo;s&mdash;enow&mdash;and I think, gentlemen, you
know something of two of those clippers yourselves (<i>with a
knowing look</i>).&nbsp; Well, you see we have law for what we
do.&nbsp; These Spaniards are carrying specie from Spain to
support their bloody war against our friends in the low
countries, who are gallantly fighting for civil and religious
liberty.&nbsp; We have resolved the gold shall never reach its
destination&mdash;we shall baulk Philip in that at least, and so
far, help our brethren in the faith.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Killigrew</span> (<i>laughing as if at a
good joke</i>).&nbsp; Hold on!&nbsp; Hold on! every inch there,
Tom; is that your only object?&nbsp; Suppose it were to be
employed in some work of charity would the Rovers take the same
interest in it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Cobham</span>.&nbsp; Well, Harry, you who
have spent such a peaceful life&mdash;you who never sunk a
Spaniard or overhauled a wine brig, and ran the contents on the
sands of Lowestoft, you can do what you like with your share
(<i>They laugh at the sarcasm</i>).</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>.&nbsp; I say, Killigrew,
that&rsquo;s a broadside!&nbsp; Tom carries too many guns for
you!&nbsp; Ha! ha! ha! (<i>laughter in which all join</i>).</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Cobham</span>.&nbsp; But you see I have
spent my life fighting for religion and vengeance, and, with the
help of God, will so continue to the end (<i>with firm
resolution</i>) I can&rsquo;t forgot the times of Wyatt!</p>
<p><a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span><span
class="smcap">Killigrew</span>.&nbsp; Well, it helps the work,
Tom, when there is good plunder as well as
vengeance.&mdash;Somehow, I cannot help thinking that if they
carried corn instead of gold and silver, they might have
continued their voyage.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Cobham</span>.&nbsp; That is as it may
be.&nbsp; If they hailed from a Protestant country&mdash;England
or Holland&mdash;or carried a neutral flag, Moor, Greek, or
Turk.&mdash;But Spain and her Inquisition sets my blood a
boiling, I would sink one of her ships with all hands; even if
freighted with manure or sand.&nbsp; Do you think our blood is to
cry to Heaven in vain for vengeance?&nbsp; Not while Thomas
Cobham has one shot in the locker&mdash;a Rover&rsquo;s deck,
manned with fifty free, daring boys, that can fight five hundred
or a thousand Spaniards wherever we meet them on the ocean.&nbsp;
But with respect to these Spaniards I cannot see any good reason,
why we should not spoil, as well as slay, the Philistines.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>Enter</i> <span
class="smcap">Sir Edward Horsey</span> <i>from behind</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Horsey</span>.&nbsp; Praise the
Lord!&nbsp; England has still one of her saints left&mdash;spoken
like a true son of a Puritan!&nbsp; You have chapter and verse
for that&mdash;go-a-head, Tom,&mdash;slay and take possession,
and when your hand is in the throat of the common foe, Edward
Horsey is not the man to baulk you in your purpose.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>They all shake hands with the
new-comer</i>, <i>laughing</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Cobham</span>.&nbsp; Ned!&nbsp; I am glad
to see you.&nbsp; I beg your pardon! (<i>bowing low</i>).&nbsp;
Sir Edward Horsey!&nbsp; Why man, I understand the Queen has
knighted you and made you Governor of the Isle of Wight.&nbsp;
She is coming to her senses, and recognizing her true friends at
last&mdash;a Rover of the genuine stamp (<i>laughing
exultingly</i>) Governor of the Isle of Wight!&nbsp; No Frenchman
or Spaniard will land there I trow.&nbsp; She sees that the real
defence of the coast, as well as the ultimate overthrow of Spain
and the possession of the Trident, lies with the free flag, and
must pass to England through her Freebooters.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Killigrew</span>.&nbsp; Well she is
beginning to see, that we are the men that she must rely on at
last, and even Cecil is opening his eyes.&nbsp; This last affair
of Sir John Hawkins, so base, cowardly, and cruel.&nbsp; Such an
outrage upon truth and honour.&nbsp; Her pride has been seriously
hurt, and you see she was a large partner in the venture, and the
profits of enormous value, entirely lost.&nbsp; This has wounded
our Queen in the tenderest part&mdash;her pocket.&nbsp; She has
sent me down to ascertain if any direct tidings have come to
hand&mdash;and to consult with William Hawkins and the rest of
you, what can be done.&nbsp; She does not like open war, and
fears Philip will declare it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Cobham</span>.&nbsp; How can he further
declare it than by his acts?&nbsp; Has he not, as far as Edicts
can, closed his Ports against us, and attempted to destroy our
trade with the Flemings, who cannot do without us.&nbsp; Bah! has
not Hawkins boldly and seamanly answered the challenge just
before he sailed, by firing upon a Spanish Man of War, with
prisoners, in Plymouth Harbour?&nbsp; What is peace and what
war.&nbsp; Well!&nbsp; I fear Spanish justice has overtaken him
at last with all his tricks and finesse, and all his gallantry
and skill, what is the truth?&nbsp; Is there any intelligence at
all, William?&nbsp; That is what I followed you up to hear.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>.&nbsp; Nothing direct, I
fear the worst.&nbsp; That they are all gone down after the
battle, or worse perhaps, taken, and handed over to the
Inquisition.&nbsp; The dreaded name of Hawkins, would bring down
on them, the full vials of Philip&rsquo;s wrath.&nbsp; Whatever
we know, is from Spanish sources&mdash;Killigrew can give it
authentic, through the Government.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Killigrew</span>.&nbsp; Alas!&nbsp; We
expect information here.&nbsp; A terrible battle has been
fought.&nbsp; The Queen&rsquo;s ship the Jesus, with immense
value has been captured <a name="page30"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 30</span>by the Spaniards, and a vast number
of English killed, or made prisoners.&nbsp; Some of the smaller
vessels however got away.&nbsp; The Ambassador observes strict
silence of Sir John, or Drake, we can learn nothing, the disaster
has been terrific, we fear they are all gone.&nbsp; The Queen is
in a rage, and says we may go at the treasure ships, that have
taken refuge in our ports.&nbsp; I have taken measures to secure
those at Southampton, before coming to give you the hint, and to
seize these here.&nbsp; She is determined on redress.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Cobham</span>.&nbsp; You see by what I
have said, I did not wait for any hints.&nbsp; Don Francisco
Diaz, lying there beside my lugger, carries as freight about half
a million a Genoese loan to Philip, for which the Duke of Alva
hangs fire, his army being in mutiny for their arrears of
pay.&nbsp; The Duke promised Philip, that he could make the war
self-supporting.&nbsp; He has failed entirely.&nbsp; The Flemings
are too much for him in that, they carry off their
valuables.&nbsp; He gains battles but there is no plunder!&nbsp;
(<i>He turns his eye to the Spanish ship and raising his finger
addresses her</i>).&nbsp; Don Francisco Diaz!&nbsp; Thou shalt
not deliver thy precious freight at Antwerp!&nbsp; (<i>Cheers in
the offing</i>).</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Killigrew</span>, (<i>laying his hand
on</i> <span class="smcap">Cobham&rsquo;s</span>

Something of importance.&nbsp; (<i>They all look</i>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>.&nbsp; What can be
up?&nbsp; They are crowding to the beach, and the piers.&nbsp;
The cruisers too, they are firing salutes in the offing and
showing their bunting.&nbsp; What can it mean?&nbsp; Surely that
was a cheer, rolling down upon the wind.&nbsp; Let us go and see,
besides, there are queer rumours I should like you to hear
whispered about the disaster of our friends, said to come from
the Spaniards in the harbour.&nbsp; (<i>A cheer in the
offing</i>).</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Cobham</span>.&nbsp; That is an undoubled
cheer in the offing.&nbsp; There is something ill the wind, go
a-head.&nbsp; (<i>Exeunt</i>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>.&nbsp; Let us get among the
sailors and hear what they think, their instinct for the real is
marvellous, as their far-sightedness at sea.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s a
group of the right sort for us!&nbsp; <i>Pointing to some
powerful men of haughty bearing and daring expression</i>,
<i>dressed in a superior style</i>, <i>flaunting gold chains and
massive jewellery</i>, <i>with Indian silk handkerchiefs
carelessly worn</i>, <i>and other marks of wealth obstentiously
displayed</i>.&nbsp; <i>They seem not only to stand aloof by
themselves but to shoulder their way without considering much
whether or not</i>, <i>they give offence</i>.&nbsp; <i>As</i>
<span class="smcap">Hawkins</span> <i>and his companions make
their way into the group one of them salutes with an air of
recognition</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Sailor</span>.&nbsp; Good day,
Captain!&nbsp; If there were Spaniards here, I would say to them
&ldquo;War hawks, make all sail!&rdquo;&nbsp; (<i>Looking with a
knowing wink at his companions</i>).</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>.&nbsp; Why, Bill
Carvell!&nbsp; Is it you?&nbsp; What&rsquo;s all this stir and
curiosity about?&nbsp; They are firing salutes, and cheering, in
the offing.&nbsp; (<i>Rounds of cheers</i>, <i>firing of
salutes</i>, <i>and hoisting of flags by the cruizers echoes
along the shore by the people</i>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Carvell</span>.&nbsp; It is only that poor
cripple limping into the harbour, with broken legs.&nbsp; She is
tattered, and torn, wounded and weak; and no mistake whether by
storm or battle.</p>
<p>2nd <span class="smcap">Sailor</span>.&nbsp; Not so overweak,
that she cloud not take her own part, in case of need.&nbsp; She
has a dammed rakish look about her, like some broken down
gentle-woman, whose rank no poverty can conceal!&nbsp; I can see
her pride and high spirit, though all her rags.&nbsp; See how she
answers the helm, and takes the windward of that great Flemish
bark!</p>
<p><a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>3rd
<span class="smcap">Sailor</span>, (<i>with a knowing emphasis
and nod</i>).&nbsp; She&rsquo;s off a long voyage, and carries no
freight; unless perhaps, it may be a dust or so of the precious
metals.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m mistaken if she&rsquo;s not in fighting
gear, as well as sailing trim.</p>
<p>4th <span class="smcap">Sailor</span>.&nbsp; She has passed
through a heavy gale, her rigging is sadly mawled.</p>
<p>3rd <span class="smcap">Sailor</span>.&nbsp; Gale be
damned!&nbsp; It has been a thunder storm with iron for
hail!&nbsp; No wind or waves ever did that damage.&nbsp; Those
bulwarks have shot holes in them, man.&nbsp; Some Spaniard has
got the worst of it, with that Falcon.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>.&nbsp; What think you of
her, Bill Carvell?&nbsp; Have you any guess?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Carvell</span>.&nbsp; I am quite out of my
reckoning, and yet I think she is no stranger.&nbsp; But you see
her spars are so handled, and the main is only a jury mast.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hawkins</span>.&nbsp; I imagine somehow, I
know the sheer of her gunwale, and the manner in which the
foremost is stepped, (<i>Aside to himself</i>), can it be?&nbsp;
(<i>Shouts of</i> &ldquo;<i>The Judith</i>, <i>The
Judith</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; <i>Tremendous cheering</i>).&nbsp; Yes
it is!&nbsp; It is the Judith and Francis Drake, if he is
alive.</p>
<p class="gutsumm"><i>The cheering and rushing about

for one of them.&nbsp; See how the privateers gather round
her.&nbsp; Hurrah my boys.&nbsp; Stand by to lend her a
hand.&nbsp; (<i>He runs about</i>).&nbsp; Get a hausser to the

<p class="gutsumm"><i>The vessel is hauled alongside</i>, <span

GREENWICH PALACE.</h4>

class="smcap">Spanish Ambassador</span>).</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Ambassador</span>.&nbsp; Three large and
richly laden merchant ships for Flanders, after a brave defence,
taken off the Goodwins, and their crews massacred, drowned or
captive!&nbsp; A Spanish vessel saw the fight, and barely escaped
to tell of the event.&nbsp; There is scarce a day that some prize
is not brought into Plymouth, Dover, or Southampton; the cargoes,
and often the passengers, openly sold, and the ships confiscated,
or armed and added to their fleet if suitable.&nbsp; These sail
in and out under English colours.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Queen Elizabeth</span>
(<i>laughing</i>).&nbsp; English Colours.&nbsp; Ha! Ha! Ha!&nbsp;
Every one knows that Pirates show as many colours as the dying
Dolphin&mdash;no doubt Spanish when it suits them.&nbsp; Well, I
suppose the crews taken were Spaniards, and the Corsairs Flemish,
driven to the sea by the persecutions of Alva, and who have dealt
to their enemies the measure of mercy, that he has shown their
murdered families.&nbsp; You see your faithless mode of warfare
makes war to the knife!&nbsp; Look what happened at
Rotterdam.&nbsp; The town in terror, shut its gates against
Alva&rsquo;s Stadtholder.&nbsp; Bossu entreated them to allow his
men only to pass through, and solemnly swore that no hurt should
be done to any one.&nbsp; The Burghers consented.&nbsp; What
better disposition could be shown by loyal subjects?&nbsp; Well,
how were they treated?&nbsp; Humanity recoils from the
thought.&nbsp; Men, women and children were put to the sword with
the practice of the most brutal atrocities, (<i>with great
emotion</i>).&nbsp; Defenceless women!&nbsp; Innocent
children.&nbsp; What robbers?&nbsp; What Corsairs ever disgraced
their manhood like this?&nbsp; (<i>She walks about
indignant</i>).&nbsp; Talk no more of Tom Cobham making a winding
sheet of a mainsail, or of flinging men into the sea in just
vengeance against your tyranny.&nbsp; Their acts are mercy when
compared with the civilised warfare of Spanish Generals.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Ambassador</span>.&nbsp; Promises made to
rebels are not binding after they have answered their
purpose.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Queen Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp;
Oh!&nbsp; You throw the responsibility on your master.&nbsp; Just
so!&nbsp; Just so! (<i>with a sarcastic laugh</i>), just what I
expected.&nbsp; <a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
33</span>Perjury!&nbsp; Treachery!&nbsp; Open premeditated lying
are legitimate strategy in Spanish warfare.&nbsp; We read in
history of Punie faith.&nbsp; Now we know the faith of
Spain.&nbsp; Carthage is outdone in Perfidy (<i>she walks aside
with a sarcastic laugh</i>).&nbsp; How often have I said, and
said justly, that I decline to interfere with Corsairs that keep
the peace in my own realm.&nbsp; Your master must take care of
his own.&nbsp; (<i>With emphasis</i>).&nbsp; My merchantmen
don&rsquo;t ask either him or me for protection, though they have
been attacked in the Mediterranean by the Royal Navy of
Spain.&nbsp; They repelled the attacks in defiance of all odds
against them.&nbsp; English sailors know how to take their own
part, and scorn to lower their flag to any numbers.&nbsp; Your
master&rsquo;s complaints are a sham to cover his own
delinquencies.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis I that have a right to
complain.&nbsp; Twenty six of my subjects burned at the stake in
one year by the Inquisition in your Master&rsquo;s dominions,
hundreds rotting in their dungeons.&nbsp; My ears are
wounded!&nbsp; My heart bleeds to hear the cries of their widows
and orphans.&nbsp; (<i>She storms about</i>).</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Ambassador</span> (<i>hurriedly</i>.&nbsp;
<i>Anxious to get away</i>).&nbsp; Your Majesty will pardon me
for declining to go into this subject.&nbsp; I have no
instructions, I will now take leave.&nbsp; (<i>Aside going

<p><span class="smcap">Queen</span> (<i>eagerly</i>).&nbsp; Well,
Sir Henry, what has been done?&nbsp; How does our account stand
now with Spain?&nbsp; This affair of Hawkins.&nbsp; We must
re-imburse ourselves without stint or hesitation.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
resolved.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Killigrew</span>.&nbsp; We are pretty safe
now; I have seized all the speice of Spain in our
harbours&mdash;a good round sum.&nbsp; And there is a capital
joke in it, beside the value.&nbsp; It turns out to be a Genoese
loan to Philip, to be delivered at Antwerp.&nbsp; It cannot be
his till delivered.&nbsp; But if he does not agree to pay it, he
will certainly get no more money from the Jews, and Alva will be
in a fix.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Queen</span> (<i>laughing</i>).&nbsp;
Oh!&nbsp; Capital indeed, I shall take the loan; Ha! Ha! Ha!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Leicester</span> (<i>laughing</i>.)&nbsp;
Loan! it will be along one, I fancy, but Hatton says it is no
one&rsquo;s property.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Queen</span>.&nbsp; Hatton says!&nbsp;
Hatton&rsquo;s opinion!&nbsp; You know he&rsquo;s my sheep,
I&rsquo;ll show you the value of his bleating, for I&rsquo;ll
take care to prove that it is my property, and mine it shall
remain.&nbsp; I sent Captain Holstook out with a squadron
immediately, before they should have time for precautions, and he
was not long in finding quarry.&nbsp; He has already, in addition
to odd Spanish prizes of considerable value, secured two fleets
of Flemish merchantmen, one now in Harwich and the other in the
Thames.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Killigrew</span>.&nbsp; And there is not a
day that the privateers don&rsquo;t bring a rich prize or two
into Dover, Plymouth, or Southampton.&nbsp; Not to speak of the
wine brigs, on the sly, discharged along the coast.&nbsp; When
all is counted up, Philip will find his murderous attack on
Hawkins and the illegal seizure of our traders&rsquo; capital,
guaranteed by treaty, a losing game.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Queen</span>.&nbsp; I have just arranged
for my morning ride, and the French Ambassador is to accompany
me.&nbsp; I am curious to ascertain the effect of these measures
of retaliation in that quarter.&nbsp; I have my reasons for
it.&nbsp; Besides, I wish them to see what they are to expect
should they dare to trespass on my realm.&nbsp;

creed of every Englishman, born within the inspiring influence of
the four seas.&nbsp; With this spirit-stirring notion they must

when shallow pated politicians and place-hunting doctrine-mongers
teach them other ways, and curb with their enactments and
official rules the daring spirit of our seamen.</p>

navy!&nbsp; Our western counties have just sent forth a fleet
(<i>with emphasis</i>) thirty cruizers at their own expense,
which can, and will, command the Channel.&nbsp; They swear
they&rsquo;ll have the ocean and the Indies for this
country.&nbsp; Philip will have enough to do, guarding his coast
and gold-ships, without assailing us.&nbsp; War, you say, call
you this peace?&mdash;to aim assassins&rsquo; daggers at my
life&mdash;to violate our solemn treaties&mdash;stop our
commerce, seize our ships and cargoes, consign our noble seamen
to flames, or to rot by hundreds in his dungeons.&mdash;I call
this the worst of wars.&nbsp; Open war he dare not wage.&nbsp;
France could not allow him.&nbsp; She would fall next.&nbsp;
Between them we are safe.&nbsp; (<i>With disdain</i>) Not that I
fear either&mdash;England can defend herself.&nbsp; In this my
people are agreed.&nbsp; No foreign despot shall ever rule
them.&nbsp; You see my mind&rsquo;s made up, so to the Council
and tell them so (<i>she walks aside decided</i>.&nbsp;
<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Cecil</span>)&nbsp; No Royal
Navy?&nbsp; What of our twenty great ships reviewed so lately,
whose crews and power were held so high that foreign nations have
already named me &ldquo;Queen of the Seas&mdash;Restorer of Naval
Glory?&rdquo;&nbsp; What of our great ships of commerce, which
our merchants have armed for war&mdash;able to fight their way
upon the waves and ready at a moment&rsquo;s notice to join our
fleet?&nbsp; Where is Philip&rsquo;s navy?&nbsp; Engaged as
convoys of his Indian trade.&nbsp; Concentrate that for an attack
on us, what would become of his gold-ships?&nbsp; Our privateers
would have them before a month anchored in the Thames.&nbsp; So
think Hawkins, Drake, Lord William Howard, and all that band of
men who know something about the business.&nbsp; Lastly, I have
Drake&rsquo;s gigantic scheme, locked safe and secret in my
Cabinet, to seize the Newfoundland fishing-fleet, twenty-five
thousand fisherman! and thus leave Spain without a sailor to man
her navy&mdash;then to take possession of her gold-ships and the
Indies.&nbsp; I confess that startled, almost frightened
me.&nbsp; Conception vast!&nbsp; Genius!&nbsp; Greatness!&nbsp;
Inspiration!&nbsp; Invasion is impossible!&nbsp; With Drake
alone, England, thou art safe! (<i>exit</i>)</p>

PACHA.</h4>
<p class="gutsumm"><i>Nombre de Dios</i>.&nbsp;
<i>Moonlight</i>.&nbsp; <i>The bright Caribean sea and luminous
sky</i>.&nbsp; <i>The islands with their picturesque forms and
foliage</i>.&nbsp; <i>The ample bay with its rivers</i>.&nbsp;
<i>The land covered with forest</i>.&nbsp; <i>The mountains in
the far distance</i>, <i>with snow-clad summits</i>, <i>above the
range of the highest clouds</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Drake</span>.&nbsp; Land of wonder!&nbsp;
Beauty!&nbsp; Richness!&nbsp; Abundance! which poets in their
wildest flights of fancy never dreamed
of.&mdash;Beyond!&mdash;The vast continent, stretching one knows
not whither.&nbsp; Whose bowels teem with gold.&nbsp; The
appanage of a single crown.&nbsp; Such is the greatness and the
wealth of Philip&mdash;enough to conquer or to bribe the world
wasted in his feeble hand.&nbsp; Our cockle-shells have sailed
these summer seas without control.&nbsp; Spain&rsquo;s giant
frame asleep&mdash;incapable&mdash;or paralysed.&nbsp; How easy
to sweep her from the sea.&nbsp; That looms in the future.&nbsp;
It flits before me like distant land&mdash;now seen in
sunshine&mdash;now lost in haze&mdash;a shapeless form.&nbsp;
Still the vision never leaves me.&nbsp; Even in my sleep my
country grapples her; always
triumphant&mdash;fiercer&mdash;stronger every time.&nbsp; The
death struggle wakes me&mdash;I see it clearly&mdash;Spain
falls&mdash;and England takes her place.&nbsp; Here comes our
canoe of observation, her low black outline scarce
distinguishable from a ripple of the ocean (<i>the boat comes
alongside</i>, <span class="smcap">John Drake</span> <i>and</i>
<span class="smcap">Oxenham</span>, <i>with an Indian</i>,
<i>climb upon the deck</i>) Well Brother, I trust a good
report?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John Drake</span>.&nbsp; The course is
clear.&nbsp; Seize the batteries and take what you
like.&mdash;There&rsquo;s not an armed ship in the harbour.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Drake</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll give them a
lesson for the one they taught me at San Juan de Ulloa.&nbsp;
Therefore cut down, burn, destroy&mdash;save only gold, silver,
jewels, and things worth carrying away.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll teach
them to leave off their bloody work.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Oxenham</span>.&nbsp; Well, General, we
have done pretty fair, to put our hands in practice.&nbsp; For
months we have sailed through these parts&mdash;sacking towns,
burning houses, sinking ships, crews and all, plundering and
taking prizes, without being over scrupulous as to kind or
quantity.&nbsp; Has there been a church, within our reach, where
we have left a chalice, or a crucifix, worth carrying away?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Drake</span>.&nbsp; The real work is now
beginning.&nbsp; This Nombre de Dios is the shipping port for
Spain&mdash;the store house of her treasure.&nbsp; Gold abounds
here.&nbsp; Men, women, children&mdash;the proud
Castillian&mdash;the feeble Creole&mdash;the wild Indian, are
covered with it.&nbsp; Who is this you have brought with you?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Oxenham</span>.&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp; We have
found a treasure worth the whole plunder of the town.&nbsp; This
is one of the noble Symerons, who defend their country against
the invader.&nbsp; He will tell you all, and introduce you to his
countrymen, at war with the Spaniards.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Drake</span>.&nbsp; Oh, excellent! (<i>he
turns to the Indian</i>) I am glad to be acquainted with one of
the oppressed children of the land.&nbsp; We English hate
Spaniards like you, and have come here to make war upon
them.&nbsp; What is your name?</p>
<p><a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span><span
class="smcap">Indian</span>.&nbsp; Chiruca.&mdash;I am son of the
Great Cacique who after the massacre of our people by the cruel
Alonzo de Ojeda and the robber Enciso, rallied our nations
against the invaders.&nbsp; We have heard of the brave Inglesos,
and the terrible Drake.&nbsp; I came to seek you with an offer of
friendship.&nbsp; Five great Caciques, with all their warriors,
will join you against the foe.&nbsp; I will be your guide to
them.&nbsp; You must go up the rivers of Panama&mdash;fight them
in the woods, and seize the Racoes with the treasure.&nbsp; Our
nation will assist you.&nbsp; I shall send Symerons by land to
bring them to meet us.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Drake</span>.&nbsp; The thing I most
desire is to cross the Isthmus and catch a glimpse of the great
ocean on the other side.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Chiruca</span>.&nbsp; Nothing can be
easier.&nbsp; We shall conduct you through fruit-laden forests,
which yet a Spanish foot hath never cursed.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Drake</span>.&nbsp; Good!&nbsp; When we
shall have surprised and plundered Nombre de Dios.&nbsp; (<i>The
men are bustling into the boats and making ready for the
attack</i>.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Moon</span> <i>salutes</i>
<span class="smcap">Drake</span> <i>and eagerly
observes</i>).</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Moon</span>.&nbsp; That galleon at anchor,
General!&mdash;Would&rsquo;nt it be as well to cut away her
rigging and send adrift her boats, as we go in?&nbsp; She might
make sail whilst we are engaged.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Drake</span>.&nbsp; Well said, my
boy.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll see to that.&nbsp; Clip her wings and
make her wait our pleasure.&nbsp; We can ease her of her precious
burden at our leisure.&nbsp; Now, my men, for action!&nbsp;
Nombre de Dios is a victim bound for slaughter, and delivered
into our hands.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Moon</span> (<i>saluting</i>).&nbsp; The
Pinnaces and boats, General, are manned and ready.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>Officers are bustling about and
giving orders</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Drake</span>.&nbsp; Well done, Moon!&nbsp;
You wait for orders.&nbsp; (<i>To</i> <span
class="smcap">Oxenham.</span>)&nbsp; A word before we start,
Oxenham.&nbsp; You land on the left&mdash;lead your corps round
to the back.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Oxenham</span>.&nbsp; And that high ground
on the east, General.&nbsp; There might be cannon there?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Drake</span>.&nbsp; Take it in your
way.&nbsp; Then push for the eastern gate; it leads to the royal
treasure house.&nbsp; Wait there the signal.&nbsp; Here is a plan
of the place (<i>he points to it with his finger as he gives it
to him</i>, <i>explaining it</i>).&nbsp; You see the course is
clear and simple.&nbsp; When you hear the first volley, rush in
with tremendous shouting, and meet me in the market-place.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Oxenham</span>.&nbsp; I shall be there, if
alive.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>Exit</i> <span

<p><span class="smcap">Oxenham</span>.&nbsp; Hurrah my boys!
(<i>the bowmen shoot cheering</i>).&nbsp; Hah!&nbsp; They
can&rsquo;t stand that sort of storm blast, in these latitudes,
general.&nbsp; We have carried all before us.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Drake</span>.&nbsp; The town is
ours.&nbsp; Now to secure the treasure.&nbsp;

they lead us to the treasure store.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Drake</span> (<i>in much delight and

<p><span class="smcap">English</span> (<i>shouting</i>).&nbsp; To
the treasure store!&nbsp; To the treasure store!</p>
<p>1st <span class="smcap">Spaniard</span>.&nbsp; Here is the
king&rsquo;s treasure house at hand!&nbsp; (<i>He turns to
another side of the Market-place</i>, <i>and points to a wide
door open</i>, <i>with lights burning</i>, <i>exposing piles of
gold and silver bars</i>, <i>with quantities of precious
stones</i>).&nbsp; How strange!&nbsp; The great doors open, and
lights burning! (<i>aside</i>), some traitor&mdash;an Indian
perhaps.&nbsp; There is treasure for you, enough to freight a
fleet.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Oxenham</span>.&nbsp; We don&rsquo;t want
so much at present.&nbsp; Only about fifty tons of gold, and a
few cases of the largest pearls and emeralds, (<i>cheers and
laughter</i>).&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what I call moderation.&nbsp;
But we shall pay you another visit, (<i>he points to the
heaps</i>).&nbsp; I say Moon, there&rsquo;s something to look
at.</p>
<p>2nd <span class="smcap">Spaniard</span>.&nbsp; I have been a
merchant, accustomed to the wealth of Spain, in the East, and in
the West, and can say the world has never seen such a mass of
treasure.&nbsp; That single pile of silver bars is seventy feet
long, ten wide, and twelve feet deep; I have measured it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Drake</span>, <i>who has been badly
wounded in the action</i>, <i>is seized with weakness and
staggers for support</i>, <i>leaning on his sword</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Drake</span>.&nbsp; Oxenham, you and Moon
will see to all this.&nbsp; I am faint with loss of blood.&nbsp;
(<i>He falls down fainting</i>, <i>alarm about him and running to
his assistance</i>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Oxenham</span>.&nbsp; Look to the General,
men.&nbsp; Give him some wine; bear a hand.&nbsp; Come on with
your flasks!&nbsp; Has no one a flask?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Moon</span>.&nbsp; All&rsquo;s right, he
revives.&nbsp; Here comes a supply?</p>
<p class="gutsumm"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">John

<p>Holy Neptune!&nbsp; The General&rsquo;s down.&nbsp;
Here&rsquo;s the drug to revive him.&nbsp; Here General&rsquo;s
the genuine sherries, the true philosophers stone
(<i>laughter</i>).&nbsp; No that&rsquo;s not it&mdash;the elixir
of life.&nbsp; Why it would raise the dead.&nbsp; See how it has
revived me.&nbsp; (<i>He staggers</i>.&nbsp;

<p><span class="smcap">Moon</span>.&nbsp; Now we have neither
corkscrew nor drinking cup, what is to be done?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Saunders</span>.&nbsp; Do you think you
lubber, Bill Saunders would forget that, and the General so
bad?&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s a bit of pewter will do what&rsquo;s
wanted, if handsomely used.&nbsp; Show me the bottle, (<i>he
seizes the bottle</i>, <i>knocks off the neck with the
tankard</i>, <i>and filing it presents it to the General with
much applause</i>).&nbsp; Drink, General!&nbsp; (<span
class="smcap">Drake</span> <i>takes the cup</i>, <i>drinks and
laughs</i>).&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the medicine&mdash;the true agua
vit&aelig;, as a murdering Spaniard would call it.&nbsp; Damn
them!&nbsp; The thieves know what&rsquo;s good, it has the
strength of Samson in it.&nbsp; Look at me that was killed dead,
and am alive again, and all from that blessed liquor.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Sailor</span>.&nbsp; If you were dead
Bill, you were dead drunk.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Saunders</span>.&nbsp; You lie like a
doctor or a lawyer.&nbsp; I was only looking after something to
revive the General.&nbsp; (<i>Laughter</i>.&nbsp; <i>He is

have you carried aboard.&nbsp; You require rest and repose and
your wounds seen to.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">All</span> (<i>crying out

it.&nbsp; Take care of the General, England can&rsquo;t spare
him.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s get him aboard.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Oxenham</span>.&nbsp; Besides, your
presence is unnecessary.&nbsp; The town is in our hands, not a
tongue durst wag, not a dog durst bark.&nbsp; They know their
masters.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Drake</span>.&nbsp; Well! brave friends
and comrades, as you will.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Drake</span>
<i>is carried away amidst cheers from his devoted crew</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Oxenham</span>.&nbsp; Now, about getting
our stuff aboard.&nbsp; Lord we could not stow the tenth part of
it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Moon</span>.&nbsp; Our Spanish friend here
is right, it would freight a fleet.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John Drake</span>.&nbsp; It would sink
ours.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Oxenham</span>.&nbsp; What a thundering
shame! to send us out on such an expedition with two or three
cockle shells, when with proper outfit and English hearts to back
us, we could enrich the nation.&nbsp; But it is always the way
with our government.&nbsp; They care more for her enemies than
for England!&nbsp; (<i>He walks aside with his hands up in great
indignation</i>).</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John Drake</span>.&nbsp; What would please
you in the way of Government, Jack?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Oxenham</span> (<i>with great
energy</i>).&nbsp; To get up a fleet, man it with true British
tars, rovers and volunteers I mean; give the command to Hawkins
or Drake, then let Philip see how long his galleons could keep
the sea, (<i>exultingly</i>).&nbsp; We would soon transfer the
Indies with all their wealth to the crown of England.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Moon</span>.&nbsp; Suppose Jack you were
in authority, as King of England.&nbsp; What then?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Oxenham</span>.&nbsp; By all the stars in
heaven I would begin with stringing to the yards arm, every Jack
in office.&nbsp; But come let us go ahead with this little
job.&nbsp; First, where&rsquo;s our transport?&nbsp; Take a guard
Moon, scour the town for horses, mules&mdash;everything that can
carry.&nbsp; (<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Moon</span> <i>and
others with him</i>).&nbsp; Now men, with a will.&nbsp; Muster
your gangs.&nbsp; (<i>Pointing to the great silver
pile</i>).&nbsp; Hurrah! upon these silver bars!&nbsp; (<i>They
rush about with bars of gold and silver</i>, <i>preparing to load
them</i>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John Drake</span>.&nbsp; Avast

all ready for it.&nbsp; Where&rsquo;s Bill Saunders?&nbsp;
He&rsquo;s the man for that.&nbsp; (<i>Laughter and

<p><span class="smcap">All</span>.&nbsp; Hurrah for the

<p><span class="smcap">Oxenham</span> (<i>looking out</i>).&nbsp;
Oh!&nbsp; I see <span class="smcap">Moon</span> coming with a

Saunders, you may as well enliven us with a stave&mdash;One of

clothes herself with hate and terror.&nbsp; Her soldiers have the
air of fiends from hell; their mission to destroy.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Moon</span>.&nbsp; There is no danger,
General.&nbsp; This is the spot&mdash;the junction of the two
streams, and the solitary cocoanut tree on the point.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Oxenham</span>.&nbsp; Right, Moon, all
right.&nbsp; There it is rearing aloft its head like a mighty
standard&mdash;its giant plumes just waving in the morning
air&mdash;no mistake!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Drake</span>.&nbsp; What a picture!&nbsp;
How strangely beautiful!&nbsp; An there were here some limner of
Nature&rsquo;s Physiognomy, with cunning to throw her wondrous
effigy on his magic canvas; that dark still water, noiseless and
deep, stealing snakelike through the monstrous foliage, mirrored
in its glassy surface; that proud Sierra; the distant horizon,
and the rising sun, tinging with purple glory its snowy tops,
sending the sheen of silver along the opening river.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Oxenham</span> (<i>abruptly</i>).&nbsp;
Here comes the canoe, like a regiment of men in single
file.&nbsp; What a length of side! and made out of a single

<p><span class="smcap">Moon</span>.&nbsp; It would puzzle a
fellow like me, with only a little arithmetic, to count
them.&nbsp; Lord! it shoots like an arrow.&nbsp; As we speak it
is at the bank.&nbsp; Hurrah! there is our friend Chiruca in the
bow.&nbsp; He is now you see an Indian Chief, and waves his eagle
plume to us.</p>

valiant of their tribes (<i>they prostrate themselves before</i>

Spain.&nbsp; I have long had this in my eye, and kept it to
myself.&nbsp; Make a nation of these Symerons, but the gold and
pearls first.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Drake</span>.&nbsp; I can see farther,

We wait for you; the sun is above the mountains, and warns us
that time passes (<span class="smcap">Drake</span> <i>takes him
by the arm and points forward</i>).</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Drake</span>.&nbsp; On then,
Chiruca.&nbsp; Looking at these precipitous rocks&mdash;those
tangled forests&mdash;those foaming cataracts&mdash;the stern
outline of that high Sierra&mdash;the task would seem
hopeless.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Chiruca</span>.&nbsp; Gold and silver, in
loads, traverse these heights on mules and llamas.&nbsp; We will
show you the Recoes and their Spanish escort.&nbsp; With your men
of iron, we shall make short work of the guard, and carry off the
treasure.&nbsp; We will ambuscade them for you, and mow them down
with poisoned arrows.&nbsp; You shall see them fly, as from a
pestilence, or the scourge of the evil one.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Drake</span>.&nbsp; Lead on.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Chiruca</span>.&nbsp; This is the
way.&nbsp; Follow me.</p>

<p><i>A retired and sacred part of the building devoted to the

<i>dressed in robes of cotton</i>, <i>elaborately

<p style="text-align: center"><i>Enter</i> <span
class="smcap">Comagre</span> <i>and</i> <span
class="smcap">Drake</span>, <i>who</i>, <i>startled and amazed at

<p><span class="smcap">Comagre</span>.&nbsp; This, noble Drake,
is the Hall of my Ancestors&mdash;the sacred mansion of the
dead.&nbsp; There they are! (<i>he points to them</i>).&nbsp; In
hours of sorrow or danger I visit them.&nbsp; Their spirits come
from the happy land to sympathise with mine.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Drake</span> (<i>much
interested</i>).&nbsp; Are these the real bodies of the
dead?&nbsp; How have they been preserved?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Comagre</span>.&nbsp; The art is of
ancient time, and came from beyond the great sea with the first
fathers of the land.&nbsp; They are dried by fire, then wrapped
in cloth of cotton with potent spices.&nbsp; Their robes are
embroidered by the hands of our women, skilled in a secret
language, which perpetuates to their descendants the memory of
their deeds.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Drake</span>.&nbsp; They are covered with
gold and precious stones, which you would do well to conceal from
the Spaniards.&nbsp; These diamonds and emeralds, these rubies
and pearls are of priceless value.&nbsp; Not all the Royal Crowns
and robes of Europe could show the like.&nbsp; They are safe from
us; but if they were the property of Spain, I would tear them
from convent, church, or altar.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Comagre</span>.&nbsp; Noble Englishman,
&rsquo;tis for this I love you, and have sought your
friendship.&nbsp; I have opened my home&mdash;my
treasures&mdash;my heart to you.&nbsp; Give us vengeance! if not
protection.&nbsp; Friend hear the wrongs of our country in the
presence of these noble dead.&nbsp; It is now a few years, since
two Spaniards, sinking under fatigue and hunger, were captured in
the forest having fled for their lives from their own cruel
countrymen.&nbsp; They should have been put to death at once,
being Spaniards, but the kindness of our nature prevailed.&nbsp;
They were saved, brought home to the village, protected,
nourished, treated as brothers.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Drake</span> (<i>deeply
interested</i>).&nbsp; How kind!&nbsp; How good!&nbsp; Well,
friend?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Comagre</span> (<i>with bitter
indignation</i>).&nbsp; Well!&nbsp; They held secret intercourse
with our foes.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Drake</span>.&nbsp; Treacherous
villains!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Comagre</span>.&nbsp; With the very men
who had doomed them to ignominious death as traitors.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Drake</span>.&nbsp; Which they
deserved.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Comagre</span>.&nbsp; Betrayed the homes,
the wealth, the secret paths of those who had
sheltered&mdash;saved them.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Drake</span> (<i>greatly
excited</i>).&nbsp; Wretches!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Comagre</span>.&nbsp; Well! without
preparation or notice, in the darkness of the night we were
attacked&mdash;robbed&mdash;massacred.&nbsp; The village was set
on fire, men, women, and children were hurled into the
flames.</p>
<p><a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span><span
class="smcap">Drake</span>.&nbsp; Inhuman monsters!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Comagre</span>.&nbsp; The morning sun rose
upon calcined bones, and blackened ruins, where before was
pleasure, loveliness and peace!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Drake</span> (<i>holding up his hands and
walking about in great excitement</i>).&nbsp; Horrible
recital!&nbsp; Barbarous, unprovoked!&nbsp; Brutal cruelty!&nbsp;
This is worse than the ravening of wild beasts.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Comagre</span> (<i>with intensified
rage</i>).&nbsp; Wild beasts!&nbsp; The rage of the most savage
beast of the forest is gentleness compared with it!&nbsp; The boa
will gorge himself and go to sleep.&nbsp; The ferocious puma will
pounce upon a single victim and his appetite for blood will be
appeased.&nbsp; But the ruthless fury of the Spaniard, when
exhausted with slaughter, calls upon the devouring flames to aid
him, and commits to senseless havoc, what his licentious appetite
cannot enjoy, or his insatiate avarice carry away!&nbsp; (<i>He
pauses breathless</i>.&nbsp; <i>Then walks about with hurried
step</i>, <i>gasping and frantic with rage</i>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Drake</span>.&nbsp; The same
everywhere&mdash;Spain wars upon mankind, like fiends.&nbsp; The
object, slavery or desolation.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Comagre</span>.&nbsp; Give us
revenge&mdash;Smite!&nbsp; Kill!&nbsp; Destroy the accursed
foe!&nbsp; On with your devastating thunder, those iron mouths
that wing their viewless death from far, that dauntless heart,
that powerful arm.&nbsp; Come on Brother; come, Revenge.&nbsp;

<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Drake</span> <i>and</i> <span
class="smcap">Chiruca</span>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Drake</span>.&nbsp; We have heard of
wonderful treasure among your people, which has escaped the
rapacity of the Spaniards.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Chiruca</span>.&nbsp; There are whole
provinces, where they have never set a foot, and where every
mountain stream runs gold.&nbsp; It may be gathered in nets and
baskets.&nbsp; The greatest collection of such riches was in the
temple of the Goddess Dobeba.&nbsp; Vasco Nunez projected its
plunder.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Drake</span>.&nbsp; The name of the Deity,
and her temple is new to me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Chiruca</span>.&nbsp; It is known and
sacred, through all the Indian races.&nbsp; Our traditions tell
us of the beginning of things, and a mighty female&mdash;the
mother of the God that made the sun and moon, and the good things
of the earth.&nbsp; She has the controul of the elements, and
directs the thunder and lightning.&nbsp; A temple of gold, with
the rarest gems and woods, was erected to her.&nbsp; Here
pilgrims flocked from far and near, bearing rich offerings.&nbsp;
Caciques of the most distant territories paid annually costly
tribute to her worship.&nbsp; The temple was filled with
treasure, walls and gates were gems and gold.&nbsp; The whole
land abounds with these as plentifully as iron with you.&nbsp;
The great Caciques furnish their tables, nay cook their viands,
in vessels constructed of gold and silver, behold that great
cattle trough at the fountain&mdash;It is of silver.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Drake</span> (<i>eagerly
interrupting</i>).&nbsp; But the golden temple and its treasures,
I hope the villains did not get them?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Chiruca</span>.&nbsp; No, friend
Drake.&nbsp; The goddess took care of that&mdash;Zemaco, Lord of
Darien, got wind of their purpose.&nbsp; Repairing thither with
the Cacique of Dobeba, he despoiled the temple, and carried off
the wealth of the Province.&nbsp; Our enemies ere they reached
the spot, found a land of desolation.&nbsp; Led into a region of
swamp and morass, with a deserted village, he looked round and
was without a guide.&nbsp; Still he picked up some thousand
ounces of gold, which the flying inhabitants had left.&nbsp;
Despatching it down the river in two canoes he began his
retreat.&nbsp; Before him yawned the morass, or spread the <a
name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
45</span>wilderness.&nbsp; Comagre had joined Zemaco, and hovered
round with thousands of Indian warriors.&nbsp; His march was
through showers of poisoned arrows, through starvation and
pestilence: for the goddess had blasted the soil!&nbsp; When the
remnant of his wretched band arrived at the coast, it was to
behold his brigantines wrecked, his canoes with their precious
freights swallowed up in the raging sea.&nbsp; The goddess moved
the elements and stirred the briny deep to avenge her on her
foes.</p>

wall, of alternate cliff and forest? (<i>turning to</i> <span

just kissed by the rising sun, and glowing in his beams like
molten silver.&nbsp; Whilst night still holds possession of hill
and valley?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Moon</span>.&nbsp; It seems to me,
General, a mighty barrier to mark the limits of the world.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Chiruca</span> (<i>amused at their
dismay</i>).&nbsp; Vasco Nunez climbed the very top, on the same
errand, and a band of followers loaded with their heavy
armour.&nbsp; They struggled over rock and
precipice&mdash;through river and torrent&mdash;through morass
and forest&mdash;and had to fight their way through hostile
nations at every step.&nbsp; One half their Lion-dogs
(<i>Leonicos</i>) as they call their bloodhounds, and a vast
number of the band, perished by fatigue, hunger, and poisoned
arrows.&nbsp; With difficulty he regained his ships with a mere
handful of his followers.&nbsp; I shall, however, conduct you by
easy paths and pleasant valleys, to a plateau, from which you
shall behold the great Pacific reposing at your feet: and gangs
of treasure-laden mules and llamas, with their escorts, worming
their difficult way across the Isthmus.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chiruca</span> (<i>archly</i>).&nbsp; I
must go foremost I see, and show you the way.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Moon</span>.&nbsp; Take my advice, and put
on a pair of wings and then have a care.&nbsp; I remember hearing
a Friar reading about some ancient philosopher who made wings,
and thought he could fly; but the sun melted the wax with <a

were stuck together, and he fell into the sea, and was
drowned.&nbsp; (<i>Laughter</i>).&nbsp; The open sea and an oak

You&rsquo;re at home there.&nbsp; (<i>Laughter</i>).</p>

ocean, which they say is boundless, save for the islands far
away, from which Tradition tells our fathers came&mdash;and where
our spirits go.&nbsp; Spain&rsquo;s proud ships pollute its
waters now, and carry gold in safety.&nbsp; There! (<i>he

treasure, and out in its beauteous bay, the Isle of Pearls,
famous for these gems, which even our Indian women prize so
highly.</p>

The very sun upon its surface pours peculiar lustre.&nbsp; It
waves seem gold&mdash;tinged with the loads they carry.&nbsp;
They shall bear a nobler freight!&nbsp; Wondrous prospect.&nbsp;
Two oceans that embrace the earth!&nbsp; But do I look with
mortal eye on real things&mdash;or rapt in Prophet frenzy, gaze
on vision?&nbsp; I feel my soul expand, o&rsquo;er time and
space, with energy divine and newborn hope.&nbsp; Two hostile
fleets contend upon the flood, and dye its waters red for
mastery.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis Spain and England!&nbsp; The World! the
prize between them!&nbsp; (<i>He looks up</i>).&nbsp; Give me, O
Heaven, to sail that sea; proclaiming to every longitude thy

<p><span class="smcap">Chiruca</span>.&nbsp; Of course!&nbsp; We

Englishman is equal to ten of them.&nbsp; We shall trap them like
wolves or buffaloes; in fact, the Spaniards will show us their
heels at the first volley from our bows; and the attendants who
hate their tyrants will lead the beasts wherever we order.&nbsp;

production!&nbsp; What art thou?&nbsp; How camest thou forth,
thus full of fearful meaning, and whence this atmosphere of
thought, surrounding thee, arresting attention for thyself,
bearing the rapt soul beyond the present, with prophecy sublime
and breathing power to tell without a tongue, of coming
greatness!&nbsp; Beneath the frenzied eye thou dost assume
proportions grand, looming its giant abstract, through dim
futurity.&nbsp; No creature of Leicester&rsquo;s paltry brain art
thou.&nbsp; No workman&rsquo;s unreflecting labour, no design of
common art assembled those ideas, above the mortal mind.&nbsp;
Conception vast!&nbsp; Some angels prompting through an
artist&rsquo;s skill, fathomless to me.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll try the
common mind!&nbsp; (<i>She turns to her waiting woman</i>).&nbsp;
Ashley, you know how high I hold your tact and judgment, in the
subtle, tortuous ways of life, your clear opinion of men and
things.&nbsp; How many changes you have seen! a rare experience
yours, through the late bloody reigns.&nbsp; Mine has been sad,
but you have lived longer.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Ashley</span>.&nbsp; Yes, my dear
mistress and still of most concern to me, was what concerned your
Royal Majesty.&nbsp; They knew well how truly I loved you, when,
on your return to Ashridge after your release from Woodstock, you
sent for me; and they committed me to the Fleet.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Queen</span>.&nbsp; Ashley, that was a
terrible time&mdash;rather say, the end of terror.&nbsp; One can
bear to recall its memory.&nbsp; It was a trumpery malice, to
send my <a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
51</span>faithful servants to prison.&nbsp; They dared not any
longer molest me, personally, for the shadow of Lord Howard fell,
like a blight, upon the Court.&nbsp; Even in his absence, his
form stalked ever before the eyes of Philip and his
Spaniards.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Ashley</span>.&nbsp; God bless the
noble Howard, the noblest of his name.&nbsp; He is the hero of
England.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Queen</span>.&nbsp; God bless him, I say
again, Ashley.&nbsp; (<i>Aside</i>).&nbsp; He has not seen this
yet.&nbsp; (<i>She lays her hand upon the emblematic

<i>deeply ponders on it</i>.)&nbsp; I wonder what he will
say.&nbsp; But his mind and bent runs in that groove, like Drake,
Hawkins, and Killigrew, the Tremaines, all that fighting
band.&nbsp; They have the one dominant idea.&nbsp; &ldquo;England
must rule the sea,&rdquo; and that they can do it.&nbsp; Look
well at that Ashley and tell me what your common sense can make
of it.&nbsp; (<i>The waiting-woman looks at the figures</i>,
<i>then at the</i> <span class="smcap">Queen</span>
<i>scrutinizingly</i>, <i>as if to find out her secret</i>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Ashley</span> (<i>with

<p><span class="smcap">Queen</span> (<i>impatiently</i>).&nbsp;

Can&rsquo;st thou read the future of thy country?</p>

of her.&nbsp; We have never chased a thing of any size or rig, we
did not overhaul.&nbsp; Lord! we could sail round any ship of
Spain, or through the very midst of her Navy.&nbsp; But this was
a wary dodge of our General, to take the round of the
Globe.&nbsp; We are safe to bring our prize home now.&nbsp; What
think you, Bill Noble?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Noble</span>.&nbsp; As for the little
craft herself, I never trod the deck of the like of her.&nbsp;
She was well named the &ldquo;Pelican.&rdquo;&nbsp; And now, in
respect of what she carries&mdash;a freight as never was
entrusted to a wooden plank before, fitly benamed the
&ldquo;Golden Hind.&rdquo;&nbsp; As to landing it safe at
Hamoaz&mdash;for the matter of speed or fighting, I should not
much mind.&nbsp; But it was never my experience to see the canvas
all spread in an unknown sea, at night.&nbsp; I have been to
China with the Portuguese and I know these channels are
dangerous!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Moon</span>.&nbsp; Lord, I am anxious to
see Old Plymouth, and hear the shouting when the Rovers salute us
sailing up the Sound, with our bunting all abroad.&mdash;It would
be a pity to shorten sail.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hixom</span>.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no
danger messmates.&nbsp; We have open sea room&mdash;the moon is
up.&mdash;How brilliant she rises, and rapid, in these
latitudes!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s all fair weather with us now.&nbsp;
(<i>Bump</i>! <i>bump</i>!)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">All</span> (<i>crying out in

<p class="gutsumm"><i>Deck of the Golden
Hind</i>&mdash;<i>Midnight</i>, <i>the moon behind a cloud</i>,
<i>constellations of the southern hemisphere brilliant in the
deep blue firmament</i>.&nbsp; <i>The ship Argo amid the
waves</i>, <i>the dove</i>, <i>bird of hope</i>.&nbsp; <i>The
raven on the back of the sea serpent</i>.&nbsp; <span

<p><span class="smcap">Drake</span> (<i>solus</i>, <i>looking at
the stars</i>).&nbsp; Yes!&nbsp; Yes!&nbsp; This is no fancy, no
vain imagination, no conceit of poesy&mdash;visible to sight and
evident to sense.&nbsp; It is, it must be&mdash;The ark of
promise, the greatest fact of history&mdash;The deluge, writ by
God himself in his own firmament, eternal monument of wrath and
justice.&nbsp; I never questioned sacred truth, but if I had that
constellation were itself enough to anchor my soul to reason, and
bid the baseless doubt begone!&nbsp; (<i>A figure appears in the
air with a book under one arm</i>, <i>whilst the other points to
the Constellation Argo</i>.&nbsp; <i>The figure is turbaned and
otherwise brilliant with the hues of an oriental
costume</i>.&nbsp; <i>His long white hair and beard float like a
streamer on the deep blue of the sky</i>.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Drake</span> <i>starts and staggers back with
uplifted hands</i>).&nbsp; Hah!&nbsp; Wherefore now?&nbsp; Is
this the end?&nbsp; Art come to see my horoscope fulfilled?&nbsp;
Zill-Allah!&nbsp; Shadow of God, Arab Astrologer, or Jew of Fez,
or whatsoe&rsquo;er thou art that visitest me so oft, in
sleeping, aye, and in waking dreams, since first I learned the
stars from thee under the clear sky of burning Africa, still as
now before me.&nbsp; Thy beard of snow floats like a meteor,
under thine arm a book, the other pointing to thy early
lesson.&nbsp; (<i>The Spirit gradually
disappears</i>&mdash;<i>dissolving into a brilliant white cloud
which suddenly becomes dark</i>, <i>whilst the dove on the ark
becomes brilliantly illumined</i>.&nbsp; <i>A voice says</i>,
&ldquo;<i>Have faith</i>, <i>look up</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Drake</span> <i>starting in horror looks
around</i>).&nbsp; Who speaks?&nbsp; (<i>No answer</i>.)&nbsp; I
do not surely dream!&nbsp; I heard a voice which said,
&ldquo;Have faith, look up.&rdquo;&nbsp; I look, (<i>a pause of
wonder</i>).&nbsp; Bright bird of hope, I take thy luminous omen,
I will have faith.&nbsp; My God, the work is Thine, Thy servant
in thy hand is but the staff, the wood cannot lift itself.&nbsp;
Let it not glory, have faith.&nbsp; (<i>He falls down upon one
knee</i>, <i>his face buried in his hands in deep
thought</i>).</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>Enter</i> <span
class="smcap">John Drake</span>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John Drake</span>.&nbsp; My brother, did
you call?&nbsp; You look troubled.&nbsp; Ah!&nbsp; This is the
last of us.&nbsp; Our stirring lives are now near acted
out.&nbsp; The first slight swell will dash our bark to
pieces.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Drake</span>.&nbsp; I fear not death, how
often have I braved it&mdash;I trust in him who hitherto has
shaped my course.&nbsp; What I have seemed to do with means <a
name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>inadequate is
evidence of power beyond me.&nbsp; My destiny is not my own to
deal with.&nbsp; He who made me has the right to end me.&nbsp;
And now I know deliverance is at hand, though human skill do
nothing towards it.&nbsp; See you this southern vault of heaven,
&rsquo;tis one great oceanic record of the past, (<i>he points to
the Constellation Argo</i>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John Drake</span>.&nbsp; You mean the
Constellation Argo, the famous ship of Jason and the Golden
Fleece.&nbsp; The dove that sits upon it!&nbsp; What a strange
light it flashes.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Drake</span>.&nbsp; Ship of Jason,
humph!&nbsp; Tradition grand, perverted to a Grecian fable.&nbsp;
That is the ark of Noah!&nbsp; I never told you how at Fez, a
sage once took strange fancy to me, and taught me knowledge of
the spheres.&nbsp; A man of wonderment and awe, he came and went
unquestioned and unknown, without a friend or country, yet with
boundless wealth.&nbsp; Some thought he was an Indian
necromancer, some a Jew, some said he was an Arab, and practised
Alchemy.&nbsp; He cast my horoscope, and told my destiny.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Born,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for great adventures, strange
revolutions on the sea, a pebble in the sling of God to smite the
power of Spain, and raise thy country to her place.&rdquo;&nbsp;
(<i>He walks musing</i>).</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John Drake</span> (<i>with
emotion</i>).&nbsp; The story, brother, is full of wonder,
strange being this!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Drake</span>.&nbsp; He showed me by the
stars&mdash;that the celestial sphere was made at Babel&mdash;a
record of the deluge when the great event was new.&nbsp;
Zill-Allah, so he called himself, &ldquo;Shadow of God,&rdquo;
knew all languages, the sacred tongues of India, Egypt,
Juda.&nbsp; The story of the flood is in them all, because they
came from Babel.&nbsp; The dispersed who formed the nations
brought them thence, who else had all been dumb, for language is
beyond invention, &rsquo;tis the gift of God.&nbsp; In that high
tower of rebel pride were lodged the sciences.&nbsp; The heavens
were charted, the celestial sphere was formed, and when the awful
deluge filled their minds, they wrote its tragic memory in the
stars.&nbsp; Argha, Arg, Ark, the same in every tongue.&nbsp; The
ship of Noah.&nbsp; (<i>He looks at his companion who is deeply
absorbed</i>, <i>then points up</i>).&nbsp; Behold the raven on
the serpents back, there is the dove&mdash;Bright bird of
hope&mdash;its symbol, there the great Father of mankind, the
victim and the altar, around the monsters of the deep and the
wild waves&mdash;(<i>Both are earnest and absorbed when the ship
rocks and slides</i>, <i>they are startled and agitated</i>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Drake</span> (<i>startled but
calm</i>).&nbsp; Thy will be done.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John Drake</span> (<i>much
excited</i>).&nbsp; God of mercy!&nbsp; She is breaking up!&nbsp;
All hands on deck!&nbsp; (<i>He runs about alarmed and
screaming</i>) she is breaking up, all hands on deck.</p>
<p class="gutsumm">(<i>The crew rush upon deck in alarm</i>,
<i>the ship rolls to one side</i>, <i>then falls off the rock
into the sea with a heavy plunge</i>, <i>as if
overwhelmed</i>&mdash;<i>a loud scream from the sailors</i>,

recovering from their alarm break into a loud cheer</i>).</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Crew</span>.&nbsp; Hurrah!&nbsp;
Hurrah!</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Scene</span> V.&mdash;ROOM IN HAMPTON
COURT.</h4>
<p class="gutsumm"><i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Queen</span>
<i>alone waiting for</i> <span class="smcap">Lord William
Howard</span>, <span class="smcap">Earl of
Effingham</span>.&nbsp; <i>She walks back and forward in deep
abstraction past a large steel mirror</i>.&nbsp; <i>She is
startled and arrested by catching sight of the reflection of
herself</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Queen</span>.&nbsp; Hah!&nbsp; What aged
companion thou, abruptly thrust upon me?&nbsp; Unflattering
mirror!&nbsp; Thou art no courtier!&nbsp; Care!&mdash;subtle
poison&mdash;sure if <a name="page55"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 55</span>slow.&mdash;I see thy
working.&mdash;Remembrancer I thank thee.&nbsp; Still!&nbsp;
Providence, I wait thy pleasure&mdash;though what a life!&nbsp;
An atmosphere of terror&mdash;my vital air&mdash;to school me,
doubtless, for thy purpose&mdash;to teach me cautious
circumspection.&nbsp; Mysterious awe hung o&rsquo;er my
childhood&mdash;the latent influence of my mother&rsquo;s fate,
though then to me unknown.&nbsp; Nordic!&nbsp; I seem alone in
this.&nbsp; The taint was upon all around&mdash;a wrinkle on
every brow&mdash;a sorrow unexpressed in midst of joy and show,
and brave festivity.&mdash;Danger and insecurity seemed to sit on
all!&nbsp; England was merry&mdash;loud the roar of
wassail.&mdash;But thoughtful people stopped short in laughter as
if chid; and swaggering, warlike Britons, though in peace, held
themselves erect for fight.&nbsp; The social heavens were black
with clouds&mdash;surcharged with thunder in the midst of
sunshine.&nbsp; Such! my earliest&mdash;undefined
impression.&nbsp; Ever present&mdash;ever coming danger!&nbsp;
Yet I feared not&mdash;rather longed to meet it face to face
(<i>she walks musing</i>).&nbsp; When Edward died, and during
Mary&rsquo;s reign, what portents scared mankind!&nbsp; Unnatural
frost bound the Earth, stifled vegetation dried up rivers.&nbsp;
The Thames was solid till the month of May!&nbsp; Showers of red
hail, like drops of gore congealed, sign of coming strife&mdash;a
nation&rsquo;s blood! and, as it lay around the roses in their
gardens, men thought of York and Lancaster, and grew pale.&nbsp;
Births of hideous monsters; frighted women; bodies with double
heads and limbs.&mdash;Storms rent the welkin with unheard of
fury, tore trees of ancient growth up by the roots, and hurled
them in wild passion through the air!&nbsp; The summer&rsquo;s
sun in hot July, as putting mourning on, grew black as winter
night.&nbsp; Rain, a second deluge! flooded the houses of
terror-stricken London, and changed its streets to
torrents.&nbsp; (<i>Her soliloquy is broken off by the entrance
of the</i> <span class="smcap">Earl of Effingham</span>.&nbsp;

<span class="smcap">Earl of Effingham</span>.&nbsp; <i>The</i>
<span class="smcap">Queen</span> <i>rushes to him</i>, <i>throws

of affection</i>, <i>and tears of filial fondness</i>.)&nbsp; My
loved!&nbsp; My honoured kinsman!&nbsp; My more than
father!&mdash;that with heroic greatness stood to the lone girl,
through danger, death, and tyranny! (<i>she is overcome with
emotion</i>).</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord William Howard</span> (<i>tenderly
looking at her whilst he still affectionately holds
her</i>).&nbsp; Thy sweet face is sad!&nbsp; What clouds thy
queenly brow?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Queen</span>.&nbsp; At sight of thee,
noble kinsman, the Tower and Woodstock, and the hostile court,
rise like hideous goblins&mdash;and the base courtiers tendering
their cold salutes, almost contempt.&nbsp; Wretches!&nbsp; I see
them in vision, cowering at the thunder of thy step and
voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;Down on your knees to her, and kiss her
hand&rdquo; you shouted.&nbsp; Oh! the dismay of Philip and his
Spaniards!&mdash;the scowl of Mary!&mdash;Alva alone was
firm.&mdash;Some one muttered
&ldquo;Treason!&mdash;Tower!&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Howard</span> (<i>with a proud and bitter
laugh</i>).&nbsp; Ha! Ha! Ha!&nbsp; The Lord High Admiral of
England, to the Tower!&mdash;with the mariners of the Royal
Navy&mdash;the fifty privateers that kept our coasts&mdash;the
best blood of England at my back&mdash;a righteous
cause&mdash;and the whole people agitated like a seething
pot&mdash;ready at a word to rise and tear your foes to
pieces!&nbsp; Philip and Alva knew better.&nbsp; Their heads were
surety for yours!&nbsp; I had let them know that your
father&rsquo;s &ldquo;deep ditch,&rdquo; as he called the
channel, lay between them and Spain, and that I was the man who
held the key of it to send them to the bottom.&nbsp; Gardiner
too, and that dark villain, Renard, were plainly told that one
move more should cost their lives!&nbsp; (<i>The</i> <span
class="smcap">Queen</span> <i>in great emotion</i>.)&nbsp; That
was a revolution for them!&nbsp; (<i>He walks aside</i>.)&nbsp;
Philip, himself, then thought it prudent to take your
part.&nbsp;&nbsp; (<i>With sarcasm</i>) Treason!&mdash;the
Tower!&mdash;Humph!&nbsp; There were other
murmurs&mdash;Outside!&mdash;So that when Arundel, <a
name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>the very head
of the Catholic party, left the palace with me, he whispered in
my ear, &ldquo;I see Elizabeth&rsquo;s foot upon the steps of the
throne.&rdquo;&nbsp; (<i>He walks aside proudly</i>.)&nbsp; My
Royal Mistress, you were safe (<i>the</i> <span
class="smcap">Queen</span> <i>in great emotion flings herself
upon him</i>).</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Queen</span>.&nbsp; Uncle mine!&nbsp;
Uncle mine!&nbsp; Call me your dear child as you did! at
Woodstock!&nbsp; Father!&nbsp; Friend!&nbsp; Under God, my
Saviour!&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas you that chained the Lions.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Howard</span> (<i>solemnly</i>).&nbsp; I
was, perhaps, an instrument!&mdash;one of the raised
up&mdash;like yourself&mdash;blind led and passive&mdash;Nor
words, nor actions, were my own!&mdash;The dictates of mysterious
power&mdash;unseen&mdash;and irresistible&mdash;ever forced me
on&mdash;that guardian angel which upheld you, and will uphold
you&mdash;long as you fulfil your purpose, and obey&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Queen</span>.&nbsp; Yes! yes!&nbsp; Noble
kinsman.&nbsp; I have reason to thank God who all my life has led
me&mdash;often by devious paths&mdash;I knew not.&mdash;The end
is his!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Howard</span>.&nbsp; Never was Monarch in
greater danger than when in your progress you stopped short at
Richmond, to sift out of his cowardice and vacillation the secret
of Norfolk&rsquo;s treason.&nbsp; What foiled the foul conspiracy
at once?&nbsp; No human light.&nbsp; The impulse was
divine!&nbsp; No secret spy; no base accomplice; no false
domestic; no unfaithful friend betrayed him.&nbsp; Your own
discerning eye unveiled his thoughts behind the flimsy shield of
shuffling falsehood and evasion.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Queen</span> (<i>abruptly</i>).&nbsp; And
when he left the court without taking leave, I saw he dared not
face me&mdash;I had probed his heart&mdash;&rsquo;twas confession
of his guilt.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Howard</span>.&nbsp; On such occasions,
you are all yourself.&nbsp; Your character breaks forth in all
its majesty of force&mdash;your resolution was electric.&nbsp; As
eagle to her eyrie, you flew to Windsor, that seat of regal pomp
and power.&nbsp; You called no councils; lost no time discussing
plans&mdash;You took the helm yourself, and instinct pointed to
the port of safety.&nbsp; To seize the prize, the very object of
rebellion, was to cut it short at a stroke!&nbsp; (<i>He walks
aside</i>).&nbsp; It was a masterly resolve to send Hunsdon
without notice or delay to carry the Queen of Scots to Tutbury,
and there to surround himself and his quarry with five hundred
men.&nbsp; The she-devil stormed, and wept, and threatened; but
Hunsdon was just the man to go through with his work.&nbsp; She
understood it all&mdash;the game was up with her.&nbsp; How I
should have laughed to see Shrewsbury&rsquo;s stupid stare, when
your order was presented to him.&nbsp; Well, it was a marvellous
conception, and marvellously executed, but the instinct was not
human; it was the dictate of that guardian angel, which I
maintain attends you through every difficulty.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Queen</span>.&nbsp; Noble kinsman, it is
strange, now that I reflect, I did it all without a
moment&rsquo;s thought, without reason, fear or motive.&nbsp; In
fact, I knew not why, but that I was constrained, and it was
done.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Howard</span> (<i>hurriedly</i>).&nbsp;
Then without an hour&rsquo;s delay, to order the greatest men in
England, Pembroke, Arundel, Lumley, and Throgmorton&mdash;to
appear at court, and there to put them under arrest.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Queen</span>.&nbsp; They were men and
patriots&mdash;friends at heart&mdash;and instantly obeyed.&nbsp;
They knew their heads were safe enough at Windsor.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Howard</span>.&nbsp; Insurrection, without
leader or object was snuffed out.&nbsp; But these are not the men
to put their country under a foreign yoke, whether of Pope or
Spain.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Queen</span>.&nbsp; Norfolk, too, I
summoned to return.&nbsp; His courage failed him, his shaking fit
came on and laid him up at Howard House to write his lying <a
name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>sneaking
letter, (<i>she shows him a latter</i>.)&nbsp; See!&nbsp; This
from a Howard, and great Surrey&rsquo;s sun.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Howard</span>.&nbsp; I am ashamed of
him.&nbsp; That ague should have taken his life, and saved his
head.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Queen</span>.&nbsp; Yet I loved him,
uncle.&nbsp; How hard to sign his execution!&nbsp; I would have
mourned his death.&nbsp; How much his fall from loyalty and
honour.&nbsp; Howards should fall on fields of
fame&mdash;Champions of England&rsquo;s freedom and
independence&mdash;a wailing country follow to their tomb, and
public monuments attest their virtue.&nbsp; Norfolk! minion to
her foe! traitor to enslave her! sinks to his doom, disgracing
his proud name.&nbsp; His friends must loathe him&mdash;rebel,
felon, slave and coward.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Howard</span>.&nbsp; He dies the worst of
traitors&mdash;his treason against his country, his
religion&mdash;against mankind.&nbsp; Perish rebellion with
him!&nbsp; England now is safe, and marches on apace, to
greatness of her own&mdash;the empire of the
ocean.&mdash;Wherefore doubt your fortune?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Queen</span> (<i>sadly</i>).&nbsp;
Kinsman, my lot is cast in loneliness, a solitary rock amid the
breakers; danger, doubt and treason ever round me, knowing not
whom to trust.&nbsp; My very council, blind to their
country&rsquo;s welfare, squabble about foreign policy, and even
if honest are divided.&nbsp; Some are for marrying me, in the
interest of Spain, some in that of France.&nbsp; Or that
I&rsquo;m lost&mdash;Even Cecil.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Howard</span> (<i>impassioned and
abrupt</i>).&nbsp; Sheer madness, either! to end in civil war,
and then in nothingness.&nbsp; Was it for the good of England
that Philip sought your hand? and now would marry you to his
minion, Austria?&nbsp; Or that France would impose her wretched
ape upon you?&nbsp; No!&nbsp; England must, and can stand alone,
against the world.&nbsp; (<i>He walks aside proudly
agitated</i>).</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Queen</span> (<i>with decision</i>).&nbsp;
Fear not, noble kinsman; never will I divide my crown with mortal
man, nor barter the glory and independence of my country.&nbsp;
Rather war! or death!&nbsp; But I am
harrassed&mdash;worried.&nbsp; My court&rsquo;s a very
comedy.&nbsp; Here are at least a dozen Ambassadors intriguing,
lying, bribing among my maids of honour as if the hand of
Elizabeth could be thus obtained.&nbsp; And (<i>laughing</i>) I
am afraid they will cut one another&rsquo;s throats in my
presence.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Howard</span> (<i>laughing</i>).&nbsp; Ha!
Ha! Ha!&nbsp; Comedy!&nbsp; By my halidame, a good one
(<i>rubbing his hands</i>).&nbsp; Lord, what fun to see the fools
draw, and go at it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Queen</span> (<i>laughing with affected
surprise</i>).&nbsp; By the soul of King Harry, Uncle, you would
make a Roman Amphitheatre in Greenwich Park, and fight them there
in pairs, like gladiators.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Howard</span> (<i>laughing</i>).&nbsp; Ha!
Ha! Ha!&nbsp; Capital!&nbsp; Pitch them into the arena, Leicester
and Hatton with them, all armed with French rapiers to skewer one
another like Woodcocks.&nbsp; We should look on as umpires.&nbsp;
But Cecil, Sussex, and Walsingham&mdash;what do they mean with
such nonsense?&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis well!?&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis
well!&nbsp; The proudest boast that woman e&rsquo;er
possessed.&nbsp; Philip himself&mdash;every prince in Europe,
that dares aspire, has sought your hand, ready to throw himself
at your feet.&nbsp; A fact to blaze upon the face of
history&mdash;a testimony to character and greatness, to silence
base detraction and endure for ever.&nbsp; Where&rsquo;s our
weakness?&nbsp; Our danger, where?&nbsp; Our only danger, low
intrigues, mixing with foreign quarrels, and false
allies.&mdash;England must dwell apart&mdash;her power&mdash;her
path to glory lies on the deep!&nbsp; Her great sons must carry
out her policy alone (<i>he walks thoughtfully and
returns</i>).&nbsp; I ever hated doctrine-mongers&mdash;men of
one idea and crooked ways&mdash;dubious! indirect! unsafe!&nbsp;
The man who loves his country, cannot mistake <a
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>her interest,
shoots straight at his mark and rarely misses.&nbsp;
Danger!&mdash;Your Fleet&mdash;the daring spirits who man
it&mdash;are the envy of the nations who have already proclaimed
you &ldquo;Queen of the Sea&mdash;Restorer of Naval
Glory.&rdquo;&nbsp; Another thing, my Queen, England&rsquo;s
Commercial Navy is a power unknown before.&nbsp; Her merchants,
enriched by growing commerce, rival each other in the ships they
build&mdash;all fit for war&mdash;with English pluck to fight
their own way upon the waves.&nbsp; These, with the Royal Navy,
present a force of twenty thousand fighting men&mdash;a match for
ten times their number any day.&nbsp; What foe will face
them?&nbsp; Ha! Ha! Ha!&nbsp; (<i>He walks aside in
triumph</i>).&nbsp; Philip could never bring his Spaniards to
that.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Queen</span> (<i>with an expression of
joy</i>).&nbsp; Noble kinsman, still the same, to comfort and
encourage me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Howard</span> (<i>earnestly</i>).&nbsp;
One thing perhaps you may want&mdash;a little money to build more
ships, and keep for difficulties.&nbsp; (<i>With an enquiring
look</i>.)&nbsp; What of Drake?&nbsp; Have they no news at
Plymouth?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Queen</span>.&nbsp; No!&nbsp; But through
Spain, notwithstanding efforts to conceal it, we know his plunder
is immense, and though every one else thinks he has gone down,
Philip, sleepless, and alarmed, is astounded, not knowing what
next may happen.&nbsp; But Drake! poor fellow! I fear is gone for
ever!&nbsp; Magellan&rsquo;s Straits are guarded&mdash;return
impossible, if alive.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Howard</span>.&nbsp; Alive!&nbsp; What
would kill them?&nbsp; If the Spaniards should kill these devils,
there would be a noise the whole world would ring with.&nbsp; As
to the straits being closed&mdash;Frobisher says there are other
passages, and that Drake&rsquo;s the man to find them.&nbsp;
Drake&rsquo;s the man!&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll find his way, my life
upon him.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Queen</span>.&nbsp; But, come, Uncle
mine!&nbsp; You&rsquo;re out of breath with this excitement, and
I have had a smart ride from London, and need refreshment.&nbsp;
I ordered my maids to horse right early.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Howard</span>.&nbsp; Ah!&nbsp; You require
your favorite beverage&mdash;a cup of good ale.&nbsp; Ale&rsquo;s
the restorer.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Queen</span>.&nbsp; You know my mind upon
that, Uncle.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the natural drink of the
nation.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Howard</span>.&nbsp; I know I have ever
seen the men fight best upon it, but I have heard that some fool
proposes a tax upon ale.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Queen</span> (<i>laughing</i>).&nbsp;
What?&nbsp; Tax an Englishman&rsquo;s ale!&nbsp; That would be
the next thing to foreign rule.&nbsp; Come, kinsman!&nbsp;
(<i>She takes his arm</i>).</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Howard</span> (<i>aside as they go

Abajo Perro!&nbsp; Down dog!&nbsp; Brave boy!&nbsp; I must see
him Drake, Ha! Ha! Ha!&nbsp; Abajo Perro!&nbsp; So he leaped
foremost aboard, felled the first Spaniard with his fist,
shouting Abajo Perro.&nbsp; God&rsquo;s death!&nbsp; How I should
like to have seen the Spaniard sprawling on the deck.&nbsp; Ha!
Ha! Ha!&nbsp; A Plymouth boy you say.&nbsp; His name, Drake?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Drake</span>.&nbsp; Thomas Moon, an it
please Your Majesty.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Queen</span>.&nbsp; Humph!&nbsp; Fellows
have been knighted for less; he&rsquo;s a hero!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Drake</span>.&nbsp; Such are the men that
England wants, my Liege.</p>
<p><a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span><span
class="smcap">Queen</span>.&nbsp; And has, Drake, I am proud to
say.&nbsp; (<i>With eagerness</i>) Come!&nbsp; Tell me about the
great gold ship.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Drake</span>.&nbsp; As we neared, one
broadside brought down her masts, a volley from our longbows
mowed her deck, like the scythe in standing corn; we shot up
alongside of her, our men rushed aboard, Thomas Moon
foremost.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Queen</span> (<i>laughing</i>).&nbsp; Ha!
Ha!&nbsp; The Plymouth boy, Abajo Perro!&nbsp; I shall never
forget that.&nbsp; Ha! Ha! Ha!&nbsp; Well, well!&nbsp; Go on.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Drake</span>.&nbsp; Well, my Liege!&nbsp;
We cut away the wreck, towed her out to sea and took charge of
the precious freight at our leisure.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Queen</span>.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the way
that British sailors do their work.&nbsp; You astonished the
Spaniards.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Drake</span>.&nbsp; Your Majesty knows the
rest.&nbsp; Magellan&rsquo;s straits were secured against me, and
I was not going to surrender what I had got.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Queen</span>.&nbsp; No, Drake was not the
man for that.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Drake</span>.&nbsp; So I decided to take
my chance, on the great unknown ocean, and by the Cape of Good
Hope.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Queen</span> (<i>thoughtfully</i>).&nbsp;
The great unknown ocean, without chart or pilot!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Drake</span> (<i>with an air of
confidence</i>).&nbsp; My Liege, I had the stars of Heaven, and
Him who set them in their courses, whose law I proclaimed from my
deck to every line of longitude on His globe!&nbsp; (<i>Looking
up with reverence</i>).&nbsp; Thus, Your Majesty&rsquo;s little
ship, having ploughed a furrow round the earth, arrived safe in
Plymouth with a nation&rsquo;s wealth in her hold.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Queen</span> (<i>eagerly</i>).&nbsp; Tell
me all!&nbsp; Tell me all.&nbsp; Strange sights, strange men,
strange lands, a tale of wonder; (<i>she muses
thoughtfully</i>).</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Drake</span>.&nbsp; Your Majesty will have
much to hear.&nbsp; The story is long as well as full of
wonder.&nbsp; Strange lands, I saw and took possession; there
flies your Royal Standard, I proclaimed you Queen.&nbsp; The
people flocked around and swore allegiance, (<i>with much
animation</i>), a land, my Liege, richer than all the realms of
Spain, a land whose streams flow over sands of gold, whose very
soil is gold.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis but to dig and wash.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Queen</span> (<i>incredulous she
rebukes</i>, <i>what she thinks exaggeration</i>, <i>with a shake
of her head</i>).&nbsp; Drake!&nbsp; Drake.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Drake</span>.&nbsp; It is true! my
Liege&mdash;I have dug, and brought it home.&nbsp; (<i>He throws
down a bag on the floor and kneels upon it</i>).&nbsp; I kneel
upon the soil, and hail Your Majesty, Queen of
California&mdash;the future goldfield of the world!&nbsp; (<i>He
rises and presents her with the bag</i>).&nbsp; I have the honour
to deliver to Your Majesty thus, part for the whole, legal
possession of California.&nbsp; (<i>She takes the bag with
curiosity and surprise</i>).</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Queen</span>.&nbsp; Is this gold?&nbsp; It
is heavy!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Drake</span>.&nbsp; There needs only to
wash it in a basin&mdash;your Majesty will see the gold at the
bottom.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Queen</span>.&nbsp; This beats
Alchemy.&nbsp; It is miracle!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll wash it with my
own hands.&nbsp; Drake, I am proud of you.&nbsp; England is proud
of you.&nbsp; Men&rsquo;s minds are filled with your name,
astounded by your achievements.&nbsp; You have covered your
country with glory, thrown over her a mantle of power.&nbsp; The
nations look up to us now and begin to think we can beat the
world.&nbsp; Philip is alarmed, and when we all thought you were
lost, he could not sleep for fear.&nbsp; He expected you to come
on the winds of heaven, to make descents upon his coast.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Drake</span> (<i>kneeling to
her</i>).&nbsp; Your Majesty&rsquo;s approval is my reward.&nbsp;
That is the pride and glory of an Englishman.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Queen</span>.&nbsp; My pride and glory is
the love and valour of my people.&nbsp; Philip, and Mendoza his
Ambassador, are clamorous for restitution, and call you a
corsair&mdash;pirate&mdash;robber! (<i>laughing</i>)</p>
<p><a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span><span
class="smcap">Drake</span>.&nbsp; Our acts are self defence and
justifiable retaliation, my Liege.&nbsp; They are the spoilers,
robbers, murderers.&nbsp; What is he doing in the Low Countries,
to a free, civilized people?&nbsp; Is he not committing wholesale
diabolical robbery and murder?&nbsp; Has he not seized our ships
in defiance of solemn treaty, trading peaceably in time of
peace?&nbsp; Whole fleets of our merchantmen, at Gibraltar and
elsewhere,&mdash;imprisoning, hanging their crews, or burning
them, in the Plazas of his cities, for the amusement of the
mob?&nbsp; And we ourselves owed him a measure of vengeance, for
the murderous affair of San Juan de Ulloa.&nbsp; But I have meted
out to him, measure for measure&mdash;pressed down&mdash;shaken
together.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Queen</span> (<i>laughing</i>).&nbsp;
Plenty of shaking, Drake.&nbsp; Plenty!&nbsp; Philip&rsquo;s fit
is not over.&nbsp; He is shaking yet.&nbsp; Cecil, too, is
shaking&mdash;frightened by Mendoza&rsquo;s bluster.&nbsp; He
says we shall have war unless we give up the
treasure&mdash;Sussex and Clinton agree with him.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t think much of that&mdash;I know them!&nbsp;
They&rsquo;re not the men to give up anything of their own
(<i>with a sarcastic smile</i>) without a fight for it.&nbsp;
They would talk another language, if they had a share in our
little venture.&nbsp; (<i>Then with intense curiosity</i>).&nbsp;
How much is it, Drake?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Drake</span>.&nbsp; Impossible to
estimate, my Liege.&nbsp; Philip puts his losses at one million
and a half.&nbsp; That applies, however, only to ascertained, and
registered quantities.&nbsp; They don&rsquo;t know the half of
what I have taken&mdash;Gold plate and bars by tons!&nbsp; What
will your majesty say to cases of pearls and emeralds as large as
pigeons&rsquo; eggs?&nbsp; I have brought, your majesty, a
sample&mdash;a little present from your honoured servant.&nbsp;
(<i>He presents her with the celebrated crown of emeralds as
large as pigeons&rsquo; eggs which she gazes on with astonishment
and delight</i>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Queen</span>.&nbsp; A crown of emeralds!
and of such magnitude.&nbsp; The like was never seen in
Europe.&nbsp; No regal brow hath ever borne the like.&nbsp;
Magnificent!&nbsp; Drake!&mdash;Drake!&nbsp; This is of unearthly
splendour.&nbsp; Thou art an enchanter, man, or hast been in
fairy-land.&nbsp; (<i>She puts the crown on her head and walks
about musing</i>; <i>then suddenly confronts him</i>.)&nbsp;
Three millions!&nbsp; Who ever dreamed of such a sum?&nbsp; It is
a nation&rsquo;s wealth!&nbsp; Give it up?&nbsp; Once in
one&rsquo;s clutches!&nbsp; Impossible!&nbsp; I could not give it
up.&nbsp; Impossible!&nbsp; (<i>She walks about exulting in the
possession</i>.&nbsp; <i>She pauses</i>, <i>and asks</i> <span
class="smcap">Drake</span>, <i>with uneasy anxiety</i>.)&nbsp;
What think you, Drake?&nbsp; Will there be war?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Drake</span>.&nbsp; Not with Spain, my
Liege, unless we declare war.&nbsp; Philip dare not&mdash;could
not, go to war with us.&nbsp; What would become of the Low
Countries then?&nbsp; He could not keep them a single week.&nbsp;
Ha! ha! ha!&nbsp; Besides!&nbsp; He has no fleet!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Queen</span>.&nbsp; No fleet?&nbsp; Our
statesmen think the sea is covered with his fleets!
(<i>ironically</i>) in fact that it is his property.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Drake</span> (<i>with a sarcastic
laugh</i>).&nbsp; Statesmen!&nbsp; Tush! tush!&nbsp; What do they
know about it?&nbsp; (<i>contemptuously</i>) Spain upon the ocean
is a <span class="smcap">Myth</span>!&nbsp; A huge ball of <span
class="smcap">Foam</span>, my Liege, without force or cohesion,
which with the first war-storm upon the angry waves, will scatter
and be seen no more!&nbsp; (<i>He walks aside with a wave of his
hand</i>; <i>then returning with a triumphant smile</i>.)&nbsp;
Can Philip guard his coasts at home; his towns; his churches;
from sack and flame?&nbsp; Can he protect his commerce?&nbsp; His
merchantmen are sunk or plundered in the channel.&nbsp; His great
officers and Nobles put up to auction in our seaports&mdash;kept
in chains like dogs, till ransomed!&nbsp; Ha! Ha! Ha!&nbsp;
(<i>Increasing in energy</i>.)&nbsp; Have I not sailed the
Caribean sea, with the cross of St. George proudly at my masthead
(<i>he looks to the</i> <span class="smcap">Queen</span> <i>in
proud triumph</i>) burning, plundering, ships and
towns?&mdash;Have I not landed on the <a name="page61"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 61</span>coast, stopped his
transports&mdash;taken his treasure&mdash;and, lastly, launched
on the Pacific, the source of all his greatness&mdash;seized his
bullion on sea and land, and carried a nation&rsquo;s wealth in
my little bark, round the globe, in triumph?&nbsp; Spain, where
is thy might?&nbsp; (<i>He walks about in grim triumph</i>,
<i>looking for approval to the</i> <span

<i>yet watching her hero with pride and exultation</i>.&nbsp;
<i>He comes up to the</i> <span class="smcap">Queen</span>
<i>solemn and serious</i>.)&nbsp; Give him this treasure, my
honoured Mistress.&nbsp; (<i>With emphasis</i>.)&nbsp; Put this
sting in him!&mdash;and then&mdash;(<i>he starts as if some
dreadful apparition had risen before him</i>, <i>to arrest his
speech and force him to contemplate it with doubt and
alarm</i>).</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Queen</span> (<i>startled at his
expression</i>, <i>with deep interest and impatience</i>).&nbsp;
You look with grave apprehension on it.&nbsp; What then?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Drake</span> (<i>slow solemn and
serious</i>).&nbsp; Why then, my Liege, not your statesmen! for
they seem too blind to fear; but your royal Majesty&mdash;our
beloved country,&mdash;nay, Europe itself, would have cause for
fear.&nbsp; My soul shrinks within me from contemplation of the
fearful consequence.&nbsp; (<i>He is greatly excited</i>,
<i>wringing his hands</i>.)&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp; My God!&nbsp; It
never struck me before&mdash;it flashes on me now&mdash;a light
from Heaven&mdash;fearful! fearful!&mdash;seas of blood!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Queen</span> (<i>excited to frenzy</i>,
<i>impatient of some dreadful apprehension</i>, <i>rushes up to
him</i>, <i>and seizing hold of him</i>, <i>shakes him for
explanation</i>.)&nbsp; God of England!&nbsp; Speak man, what
mean you?&nbsp; It must be something which quells the soul of
Drake.&mdash;What then?&nbsp; Quick.&mdash;Relieve this boding
doubt, this frantic apprehension.&nbsp; Quick!&nbsp; Quick, what
then?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Drake</span>.&nbsp; Why then, my Liege, he
would equip a fleet, collect his mighty hosts, crush the Low
Countries in an hour, annihilate our trade, blockade our
ports.&nbsp; France shrinking paralysed, overawed, and
then&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Queen</span> (<i>starting away as from a
frightful apparition</i>, <i>but with unquailing spirit rushes
about with uplifted arms and the rage of a tigress</i>.)&nbsp; I
see!&nbsp; I see!&nbsp; I see it <span
class="smcap">all</span>&mdash;Villains, fools, and traitors, I
should be left without an ally to battle with the world in
arms.&nbsp; Rebels, traitors, assassins&mdash;Fiends of Hell
within&mdash;The fleets and armies of Spain without.&nbsp; The
wars of the roses over again.&nbsp; Fierce civil strife, seas of
brothers&rsquo; blood&mdash;The proud island before whose arms
Europe has quailed, trampled into a Spanish province!&nbsp; (<i>A
pause of grim rage and sarcasm</i>), and the moles and bats would
give it to him!&nbsp; (<i>She laughs with a grim and bitter
expression of rage and exultation</i>).&nbsp; Ha! Ha! Ha!&nbsp;
They shan&rsquo;t, Drake, they shan&rsquo;t!&nbsp; Philip shall
not have one ochavo of it.&nbsp; No!&nbsp; War or no
war&mdash;never!&nbsp; Shade of Henry of Monmouth!&nbsp; Can thy
stone casement hold thee?&nbsp; (<i>She walks about with a proud
resolve then confronts him</i>).&nbsp; What then do you propose
sir?&nbsp; You are entitled to a voice in the matter.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Drake</span>.&nbsp; Your Majesty can now
take the wind out of his sails, you can build and equip the
fleet.&nbsp; Give me, my Liege, but a small one, I&rsquo;ll burn
every town upon his coast, every stick of navy he possesses, in
harbour or afloat; carry his gold fleet to England, and drive him
from the ocean in a month; (<i>he walks aside in
exultation</i>).</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Queen</span> (<i>abruptly</i>).&nbsp;
You&rsquo;re the man, Drake! you&rsquo;re the man!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Drake</span>.&nbsp; Then, my Liege, we
shall occupy California and the Indies, whose downtrodden people
will welcome you as a Saviour.&nbsp; England will become the mart
of the precious metals, the centre of universal commerce.&nbsp;
The tribes of broken humanity will come begging for the crumbs
that fall from your replenished table.&nbsp; Our great race,
(<i>elevating his voice</i>) shall spread from land to land, from
sea to sea, till one wide luminous zone of truth, of light, of
freedom, shall gird the globe; the sun shall make his eternal
round and never set in the dominions.</p>

<p class="gutsumm"><span class="smcap">Leicester&rsquo;s</span>
<i>present on a marble table</i>, <i>backed by a large steel
mirror which reflects it</i>.&nbsp; <i>The</i> <span
class="smcap">Queen</span> <i>sitting on a sofa</i>, <i>in
conversation with the</i> <span class="smcap">Earl of
Leicester</span> <i>who stands at a little distance</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Leicester</span>.&nbsp; What thinks my
royal Mistress of my symboled future now? (<i>he point to
it</i>)&nbsp; These figures seem to speak and challenge me to
ask.&mdash;I always felt that thought was inspiration!&nbsp; The
vision rapidly developes into facts.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll live to
see the symbol a reality.&nbsp; Drake&rsquo;s deeds of wonder
bring it up in force.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Queen</span>.&nbsp; Miraculous!&nbsp;
Incomprehensible!&nbsp; Drake&rsquo;s a prodigy!&mdash;At sight I
read him in the first moment&rsquo;s interview.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s
made for greatness not his own.&nbsp; A Demi-god could not
accomplish his achievements, so vast in their proportions, and
whose effects, perhaps, shall run through Time!&mdash;Nor
dare&mdash;nor even conceive them.&nbsp; A clear
impossibility&mdash;by himself to mortal man!&nbsp; The finger of
God is visible throughout for his own end&mdash;then
unseen!&nbsp; Drake&rsquo;s eyes are opened now, and so are
mine!&nbsp; I see the work and aim of Providence.&nbsp; We are
but passive instruments to carry out his will.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis
always thus, Leicester.&nbsp; I have observed it well through
life.&nbsp; God brings about His greatest ends by means, to us,
inadequate&mdash;to show His power, and that the work is His;
lest we should say &ldquo;my hand hath done it.&rdquo;&nbsp; You
see how all Drake&rsquo;s other ships were sunk or scattered to
the winds, that <span class="smcap">he</span> hurled on an
unknown ocean! <span class="smcap">left alone</span>! should be
the chosen means to change the destiny of the world.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Leicester</span>.&nbsp; It is a mighty
prize, howe&rsquo;er he dropped upon it, and marvellous as you
say.&nbsp; What power to you!&mdash;To Philip, most vexatious
loss at <a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
63</span>present&mdash;to say the least, inconvenient in the
extreme&mdash;your seizures, of that Genoese loan, and now this
treasure, have crippled him.&nbsp; He is at a stand still for
money, notwithstanding his Indies.&nbsp; Alva is in
despair&mdash;his army in mutiny.&nbsp; This would have relieved
them of all their difficulties.&nbsp; They are in a dreadful
way.&nbsp; Mendoza spluttering at a huge rate, has frightened
Cecil with a threat of war&mdash;and he in his alarm would give
it up.&nbsp; But the whole country is enthusiastic about
Drake.&mdash;He is the universal hero!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Queen</span> (<i>indignant</i>).&nbsp; A
fig for Cecil and the whole Council&mdash;a set of
fools&mdash;some are afraid of Philip&mdash;some are in his
pay.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll stick to it, Leicester&mdash;every silver
bar&mdash;every quoit of gold.&nbsp; It is the gift of
Providence&mdash;my power, my safety.&nbsp; I have had my doubts
and fears!&nbsp; Now I feel that I can defy the world.&nbsp;
Drake despises Spain; laughs at invasion; says Philip can&rsquo;t
defend himself from us.&nbsp; He swears he&rsquo;ll drive him
from the ocean in a month&mdash;and I believe him.&nbsp; He
(<i>with emphasis</i>) knows what he&rsquo;s talking about.&nbsp;
Drake&rsquo;s the man!&mdash;Drake&rsquo;s the man for me!</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>A Page announces the Spanish

Mendoza!&nbsp; I am always glad to see you&mdash;in your private
character.&nbsp; But are you now come as a King-at-Arms to
declare war?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mendoza</span>.&nbsp; No! No!&nbsp; My
instructions from my master are, to cultivate peace&mdash;But
from your Majesty&rsquo;s preparations, I should imagine that you
meant war, on a large scale.&nbsp; Your fleet at Chatham! and the
noise of fife and drum throughout the land.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Queen</span> (<i>interrupting</i>).&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis only the commission of array for training&mdash;Though
England keeps on foot no armies, she is always armed&mdash;Her
freemen are her soldiers.&nbsp; In times of danger, she gets
ready; I don&rsquo;t intend to be caught sleeping.&nbsp; What are
those mighty naval preparations for at Cadiz?&nbsp; Six thousand
additional seamen!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Ambassador</span>.&nbsp; Of that&mdash;not
having the gift of inspiration! I can give your Majesty no
information.&nbsp; My master finds no fault with you, but your
ministers encourage, and aid rebellion against his authority in
the Low Countries, and English Corsairs, not content with robbing
his merchantmen in the channel, have now extended their ravages
to the Indies and the Pacific.&nbsp; The notorious Drake is, even
now, returned with enormous booty.&nbsp; He is cherished and
feted, as if the exploits of a robber were some great national
triumph.&nbsp; His Majesty expects that you will not only order
immediate restitution, but punish the offender as he
deserves.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Queen</span>.&nbsp; Tush! Tush!&nbsp; Your
master cannot be serious.&nbsp; If so, he must either be a fool,
or think me one.&nbsp; If my ships should invade the possessions
of the King of Spain, the act could not be considered
Piracy&mdash;It would be war.&nbsp; Now your complaint shows that
the nations are at peace, and therefore that the acts are not my
acts.&nbsp; He has been a King of England, and knows well, that
the laws of England do not extend to the Pacific&mdash;Hey!
Hey!&nbsp; Our courts have neither authority to try, nor means to
punish offences committed in the other hemisphere.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Ambassador</span> (<i>with
haste</i>).&nbsp; Drake is now in England with the booty.</p>
<p><a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span><span
class="smcap">Queen</span>.&nbsp; Well!&nbsp; Drake has committed
no offence against the laws of his country.&nbsp; What exclusive
right has your master, the King of Spain, to the Indies, the
whole continent of America, and the wide Pacific?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Ambassador</span> (<i>with much
earnestness</i>).&nbsp; The Pope who, as Vicar of Christ, has
authority over the whole earth, has given the Indies and the
Pacific, to Spain.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Queen</span> (<i>laughing
outright</i>).&nbsp; Did Charles the fifth owe his empire to the
Pope, when he sent his army to imprison His Holiness and seize
the possessions of the church?&nbsp; Hey!&nbsp; Will his son
Philip acknowledge that he now owes them to the Pope?&nbsp; I
trow not!&nbsp; Let the Pope only interfere with Philip&rsquo;s
dominions&mdash;We should soon hear of another Spanish army
marching upon Rome, and probably Don Bernardino de Mendoza in
command of it, to make the Pope a second time prisoner, and shut
him up in his Castle of St. Angelo.&nbsp; That is the way Philip
would acknowledge his authority over the earth; and that you
would show your faith in it.&nbsp; Ha! Ha! Ha!&nbsp;
(<i>Laughter</i>, <i>in which</i> <span
class="smcap">Mendoza</span> <i>cannot help joining</i>.&nbsp;
<i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Queen</span> <i>walks about</i>,
<i>exulting in her triumph</i>).</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Ambassador</span>.&nbsp; That would be an
extreme case, your Majesty.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Queen</span> (<i>bursting into a
laugh</i>).&nbsp; Capital!&nbsp; An extreme case!&nbsp; It would
be an extreme case, for the Vicar of God upon earth.&nbsp; For
myself you know, I utterly deny his authority altogether, as well
as his office (<i>with sarcastic emphasis</i>).&nbsp; But look
you here, a Pope has given Ireland to England, for an eternal
possession, by a solemn bull; and yet, your master Philip has
invaded that country, to wrest it from us&mdash;His troops are at
this moment in Ireland.&nbsp; Tell your master from me, that I
will hear no complaints, nor give him any answer, until these are
withdrawn (<i>she walks proudly and defiant</i>).</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Ambassador</span>.&nbsp; I am sorry for
it, but if you allow these measures to be pursued, you will see
when too late, your throne slip from under you.&nbsp; I know your
resources, compared with those of France, and that your only
safety is behind the shield of Spain.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Queen</span> (<i>sarcastically</i>) I am
not going to quarrel with France, who with good reason, keeps a
jealous eye on Spain, you know that well, and so does
Philip.&nbsp; I intend only to maintain myself, as my father has
done before me, independent in my own realm.&nbsp; And as for
losing my throne, what raised me to it?&nbsp; Under God, my
people who, Catholic and Protestant, alike, agree in
this&mdash;To hate with all their hearts, a foreign jurisdiction
(<i>she looks with insinuation at him</i>).&nbsp; France has not
forgotten the battle of the Spurs, or the still greater lesson
taught her within living memory; when her sixty thousand men,
were driven from the shores of the Isle of Wight, like the small
dust before the whirlwind by the tall yeomen of the soil (<i>she

audacious foe that lands upon our shores, will learn to his cost
that he has to encounter men.&nbsp; The English of the present
day have not lost the spirit of their noble fathers.&nbsp; They
will defend their liberties to the death; and should they fall in
the great struggle, with the help of God, he will find the body
of their Queen, like that of the great Harold in the midst
them.&nbsp; With England I will <span class="smcap">live</span>

filled with gaily dressed spectators</i>.&nbsp; <i>All London is

presence at dinner</i>, <i>the little ship that has fought its
way round the world</i>, <i>and the heroes who manned
it</i>.&nbsp; <i>Deck of the Golden Hind covered with an
awning</i>, <i>extended with canvas on to the land in a
semi-circular form</i>; <i>open in front and supported by
pillars</i>&mdash;<i>the whole highly ornamented and painted with
scenic effect</i>, <i>to represent the great occasions of
England&rsquo;s triumph by sea and land</i>.&nbsp; <i>A
dinner-table spread with gold and silver plate</i>, <i>with
various jewelled articles in those metals</i>&mdash;<i>trophies
brought from the Indies</i>&mdash;<i>and piled with rare tropical
fruits and productions</i>, <i>since become familiar although

arms of</i> <span class="smcap">Drake</span> <i>and the
mottoes</i> &ldquo;<i>Divino auxilio</i>&rdquo; <i>above and</i>

class="smcap">Raleigh</span>; <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>,
<i>and others</i>, <i>principally those most against Spain</i>,

showing their deference to their sovereign</i>, <i>as well as
their high discipline</i>.&nbsp; <i>Great cheering</i>.&nbsp;
<i>Curtain rises</i>, <span class="smcap">Drake</span> <i>comes
forward with a large gold richly jewelled goblet filled with

<p><a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span><span
class="smcap">Queen</span>.&nbsp; Rise, Mr. Drake.&nbsp; What
would you say?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Drake</span>.&nbsp; On behalf of the crew
of the &ldquo;Golden Hind,&rdquo; I would beg your
Majesty&rsquo;s acceptance of this cup, which is probably the
most valuable ever designed for human lips&mdash;meet only for
the Monarch, whose wisdom and genius have made her country
respected and feared by the nations of the earth.&nbsp; The
goblet and the wine are the lawful prize of the valour of your
men&mdash;taken on the great Pacific, whose waters quailed
beneath the thunder of your guns.&nbsp; Both have made the
circuit of the globe, and thus been guided by Providence to the
lips of His most favoured Queen.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Queen</span> (<i>bowing to the
men</i>).&nbsp; I accept your precious gift, with thanks.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Drake</span>.&nbsp; My Liege!&nbsp; I have
another favour to ask&mdash;leave to propose a toast?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Queen</span>.&nbsp; You shall be king,
sir, on your own deck, where you have so ably
commanded&mdash;proceed!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Drake</span> (<i>turning to the company
whilst his cup-bearer hands him a golden goblet</i>)
Ladies!&nbsp; Lords!&nbsp; Noble Englishmen, and you, brothers in
arms, who in this little bark have never struck your flag to a
foe, but have carried it at your main, through storm and battle,
round the globe, fill your cups and stand.&nbsp; (<i>They fill
their cups and stand</i>, <i>a little excited</i>).&nbsp; You
have this day received an honour, which is a reward for all your
difficulties and dangers.&nbsp; Your Queen acknowledges our
services, and condescends to be our guest.&nbsp; This is no
common event in the lives of men.&nbsp; It is an <span
class="smcap">era</span> in the history of the <span
class="smcap">world</span>, which will be read, whilst one page
of the great volume lasts (<i>sensation</i>).&nbsp; We have
amongst us, the chosen of Providence, who has covered herself and
her country, with a glory which shall endure, till time shall be
no more; the <span class="smcap">elected head</span> of the <span
class="smcap">new tower</span> rising from the sea to rule the
<span class="smcap">world</span>&mdash;to send forth from England
the law of commerce and civilisation.&nbsp; (He <i>turns to
the</i> <span class="smcap">Queen</span>).&nbsp; &ldquo;For the
abundance of the sea shall be converted to you.&rdquo;&nbsp;
(<i>Turning to the company</i>).&nbsp; Hers is not the sceptre of
an Attila or a more cruel Philip, by the swords of armed men,
steeped in the blood and tears of prostrate humanity.&nbsp; The
Trident of the Ocean is the wand of peace, which shall wave over
freedom, prosperity, and law.&nbsp; (<i>Sensation</i>).&nbsp; The
fortune of our great race may be chequered, but it shall never
wane, till it has pushed its nations to the everlasting
hills.&nbsp; (<i>Turning and extending his hand towards the</i>
<span class="smcap">Queen</span>).&nbsp; Behold the fountain, the
well-head of our progress.&nbsp; When tyranny shall oppress, and
prosperity waver, England will look back with hope to her maiden
Queen.&nbsp; When her armies conquer, and her navies triumph,
when her flag o&rsquo;er sea and land shall sway the mighty and
the free.&nbsp; England will turn with pride to the origin of her
power&mdash;The reign of her maiden Queen.&nbsp; When the traitor
in the council, or the coward in the field, shall betray his
country, his honour, his faith, his God, England will fling aside
the infamy and take courage from her maiden Queen.&nbsp; When her
empire shall gird the globe, with arts, science, commerce, and
peace&mdash;When the elements themselves shall obey her, and
flash from land to land, from sea to sea, her mandates of liberty
and law, England will look to her maiden Queen as the starting
point of it all.&nbsp; (<i>He looks around</i>, <i>and raising
his goblet pronounces the toast</i>).&mdash;The Queen!&nbsp; God
bless her!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">All</span>.&nbsp; The Queen, God bless
her.&nbsp; Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
